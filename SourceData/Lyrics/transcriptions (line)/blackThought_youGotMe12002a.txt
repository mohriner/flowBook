Somebody told me that this planet was small we use to live in the same building 
on the same floor and never met before 
until I'm overseas on tour and peep this ethiopian queen 
from philly taking classes abroad 
studying film and photo flash focus record 
said she workin on a flick and could my click do the score
said she love in paris at Elysee Montmartre
and that I stepped off stage and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that things fall apart, intentions shatter 
she like that shit don't matter when I get home get at her 
through letter, phone, whatever let's link, let's get together 
shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
time passed, we in philly now she up in my spa
tellin the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
startin buildin with her constantly around the clock
now she in my world like hip hop and keep tellin me
