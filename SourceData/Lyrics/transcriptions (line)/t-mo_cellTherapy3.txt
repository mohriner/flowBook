Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you About 
what yo little ass need to be going through I fall a victim too 
and I know I shouldn't smoke so much But I do 
with the crew everybody on the average
 bout four or five I'm lucky to be alive 
 at sunrise now I realize the cost After I lost my 
 best friend Bean I recognize as a King 
 Who am I to tell you to stop smokin 
 Now you're open to disease and colds And ain't sixteen years old, 
 this shit has got to stop Let's take a walk 
 through detox I want outta this hole I'm in a cell 
 under attack Loc up folks they in the hood, 
 got an eye on every move I make 
 open your face to info you ain't know Cause it's kept low 
 how the new world plan Reeks the planet without the black man
