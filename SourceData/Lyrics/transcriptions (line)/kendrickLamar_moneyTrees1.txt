uh me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish 
hit the house lick tell me is you wit' it ya bish 
home invasion was persuasive 
from nine to five i know it's vacant ya bish 
dreams of livin' life like rappers do 
back when condom wrappers wasn't cool 
i fucked sherane and went to tell my bros 
then usher raymond let it burn came on 
hot sauce all in our top ramen ya bish 
park the car then we start rhymin' ya bish 
the only thing we had to free our mind 
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs 
you lookin' like a easy come up ya bish 
a silver spoon i know you come from ya bish 
and that's a lifestyle that we never knew 
go at a reverend for the revenue
