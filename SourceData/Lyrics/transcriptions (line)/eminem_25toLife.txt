I FEEL LIKE WHEN I BEND OVER BACKWARDS FOR YOU ALL YOU DO IS LAUGH
CAUSE THAT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH YOU EXPECT ME TO FOLD MYSELF IN HALF
TIL I SNAP DON'T THINK I'M LOYAL ALL I DO IS RAP
HOW CAN I MOONLIGHT ON THE SIDE I HAVE NO LIFE OUTSIDE OF THAT
DON'T I GIVE YOU ENOUGH OF MY TIME YOU DON'T THINK SO DO YOU
JEALOUS WHEN I SPEND TIME WITH THE GIRLS WHY I'M MARRIED TO YOU STILL MAN I DON'T KNOW
BUT TONIGHT I'M SERVING YOU WITH PAPERS I'M DIVORCING YOU
GO MARRY SOMEONE ELSE AND MAKE EM FAMOUS
AND TAKE AWAY THEIR FREEDOM LIKE YOU DID TO ME 
TREAT EM LIKE YOU DON'T NEED THEM AND THEY AIN'T WORTHY OF YOU
FEED EM THE SAME SHIT THAT YOU MADE ME EAT
I'M MOVING ON FORGET YOU OH NOW I'M SPECIAL I DIDN'T FEEL SPECIAL WHEN I WAS WITH YOU
ALL I EVER FELT WAS THIS HELPLESSNESS IMPRISONED BY A SELFISH BITCH
CHEW ME UP AND SPIT ME OUT I FELL FOR THIS 
SO MANY TIMES IT'S RIDICULOUS AND STILL I STICK WITH THIS
I'M SICK OF THIS BUT IN MY SICKNESS AND ADDICTION YOU'RE ADDICTIVE AS THEY GET
EVIL AS THEY COME VINDICTIVE AS THEY MAKE EM
MY FRIENDS KEEP ASKING ME WHY I CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM
I'M ADDICTED TO THE PAIN THE STRESS THE DRAMA
I'M DRAWN IN SO I GUESS IMMA MESS CURSED AND BLESSED BUT THIS TIME IMMA
AIN'T CHANGING MY MIND I'M CLIMBING OUT THIS ABYSS
YOU SCREAMING AS I WALK OUT THAT I'LL BE MISSED
BUT WHEN YOU SPOKE OF PEOPLE WHO MEANT THE MOST TO YOU YOU LEFT ME OFF YOUR LIST
FUCK YOU HIP HOP I'M LEAVING YOU MY LIFE SENTENCE IS SERVED BITCH AND IT'S JUST
