Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck em all
Bumping Triple Six Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me? Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it Write it,
record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
E B T, that's the card I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
