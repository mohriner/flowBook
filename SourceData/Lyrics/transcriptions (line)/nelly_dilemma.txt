I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And uhh, she got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh no, oh no She gotta a man and a
son, though But that's okay cuz I,
wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up evrything mami hitting
And in no time I plan to make this
one here mine And that's for sure cause I,
I never been the type to, break up a happy home
But uh, there's something bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma what's it gonna be? She said
You don't know what you mean to me C'mon!
