Party people got a brand new treat
On the well known tune we call Heartbeat
But we jazzed it up and we broke it down
And came out with a brand new funky sound
Now I came here to get this straight
Our heart beat's not on a normal rate
Cuz when we get excited our adrenaline flows
And this is the way our heartbeat goes
A hop, skip, and a jump But not a plain ol' bump
But but a bump, bump, bump, bump, bumpity bump
It's a brand new treat, and it sounds so sweet
The rappin' the music our new heartbeat
