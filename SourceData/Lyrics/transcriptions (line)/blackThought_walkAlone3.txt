The longest walk I'll probly ever be on 
The Road to Perdition guess I'm fin to get my plea on 
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise evry second felt as if it took an eon
Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone 
The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on 
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume 
I go above and beyond the duty called truly y'all 
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard 
Walk alone talk alone get my Charlie Parker on 
Make my mark alone shed light upon the dark alone 
Get my sparkle on it's a mission I'm embarking on 
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home
