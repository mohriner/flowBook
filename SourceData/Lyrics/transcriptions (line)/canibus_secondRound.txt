So I'ma let the
world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you Platinum, you only droppin Clue's
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes, bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drug free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggaz feel
While ninety nine percent of your fans wear high heels
From Ice T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy!
You drippin with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You betta be prepared to finish what you start nigga
