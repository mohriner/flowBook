Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
On the phone gossiping telling home girls stories
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied do her best but it's still rough
Keep your kids out the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going
