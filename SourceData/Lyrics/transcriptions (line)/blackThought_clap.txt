country's at war, little kids cry, rape, god damn it
The ghetto is the planet of the apes
Massive meltdown send in the red tape
With the cinder block shoes at the bottom of the lake
I'm from the city of sin state of the art
Using no book and no pen for making the mark
A rap clubber lane hit em with the gutter slang
I know you're insane, we another thang, 
the track bang
We put it to y'all chumps you so corny
My name, Black Thought the one person army
All the intellectuals and the thugs adore me
My lyrical range, from complex to strange
Wrecking your brain when the rhyme texture change
Hip hop fiends tapping they arm and catch a vein
Emcees scared to death, wishing i never came
