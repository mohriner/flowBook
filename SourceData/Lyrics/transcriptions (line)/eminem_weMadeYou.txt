DAMN GIRL I'M BEGINNING TO SPROUT THEN ALFALFA
WHY SHOULD I WASH MY FILTHY MOUTH OUT
YOU THINK THAT'S BAD YOU SHOULD HEAR THE REST OF MY ALBUM
NEVER HAS THEIR BEEN SUCH FINESSE AND NOSTALGIA
MAN CASH I DON'T MEAN TO MESS WITH YA GAL BUT
JESSICA ALBA PUT A BREAST IN MY MOUTH BRUH
WOWZERS I JUST MADE A MESS IN MY TROUSERS
AND THEY WONDER WHY I KEEP DRESSING LIKE ELVIS
LORD HELP US HE'S BACK AND IN HIS PINK ALF SHIRT
LOOKIN' LIKE SOMEONE SHRINKED HIS OUTFIT
I THINK HE'S BOUT TO FLIP JESSICA
REST ASSURED SUPERMAN'S HERE TO RESCUE YA
CAN YOU BLAME ME YOU'RE MY AMY I'M YOUR BLAKE
MATTER FACT MAKE ME A BIRTHDAY CAKE
WITH A SAW BLADE IN IT TO MAKE MY JAIL BREAK
BABY I THINK YOU JUST MET YOUR SOUL MATE
NOW BREAK IT DOWN GIRL
