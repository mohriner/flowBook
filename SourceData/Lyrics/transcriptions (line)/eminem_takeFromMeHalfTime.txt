I LIVE IN A BUBBLE I STRUGGLE WITH THE FAME
TROUBLE AS THE PAIN GROWS DOUBLE GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU SAY
WHEN MY MUSIC YOU TAKE SO SUBTLE JUST TO GIVE IT AWAY
TO PEOPLE WHO DONT EVEN APPRECIATE FLOWS MOTHAFUCKA IM LIVID TODAY CAUSE I BREAK MY BACK 
TO GIVE YOU MY ALL YOU STEAL MY THOUGHTS ITS LIKE DRIVING A SPIKE THROUGH MY HEART
YOU MIGHT NOT THINK ITS THAT BIG OF A DEAL TO STEAL FROM ME BUT MUSIC IS ALL I GOT 
ASIDE FROM MY DAUGHTERS NOT TO SOUND LIKE A MARTYR BUT ITS GETTING HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
TO NOT JUST GO CRAZY TRAPPED IN THIS HOUSE IM ABOUT TO JUST SNAP
AM I NOT DESERVING OF WHAT I GOT DID I NOT WORK FOR IT PUT IT ALL IN EVERY RECORD I RECORD
WELL THEN PLEASE TELL ME WHY ON THIS EARTH LORD DOES IT KEEP HAPPENING I KEEP RAPPING
BUT I WONDER SOMETIMES IS IT WORTH ALL THE BULLSHIT CAUSE IT FEELS LIKE A DOWN THERE AINT NO GETTIN UP FROM
BUT I WONT LET IT GET ME DOWN I WONT SUCCUMB IM ANYTHING BUT GLUM SO FUCK EM
THEYLL APPRECIATE ME WHEN IM GONE THEYLL SAY IT WAS ILL RIGHT THE WAY I KILL MICS BUT THE WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW
IT JUST FEELS LIKE IM SO DONE WITH THIS SHIT I MIGHT AS WELL WIPE
I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE YOU NOTHING LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE FAREWELL I BID YOU 
BUT BEFORE I GO MY LAST GIFT TO YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SLAUGHTERHOUSE I GIVE YOU
