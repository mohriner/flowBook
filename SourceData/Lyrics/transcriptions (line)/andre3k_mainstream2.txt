They swan divin' fit they name be thrashing an album 
go cart rushin' to finish their album then you find them 
lost dog paddling back stroking what done happened
be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and 
wrong ingredients maybe too much herbs and spices 
maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same 
so I'm gonna sing just like them 
to get where they at I'll even break my by back to touch their rim 
if I gotta My alta mater be that I follow 
I bite whatever that's looking tasty water it down then swallow 
I hope you vomit won't call no names cause that's not my job 
it just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are 
but if you don't you never will you just receive the steel 
but then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
the way that I felt when I wrote this but we must stay in focus 
we kings and queens up in this thing get rid of all them jokers
face down face down face down
