The common denominator the nigga numerator
never know who the hater niggaz cater to your ego 
I'm sorry like atari whose the cousin to coleco 
vision caught a rico back on the street like chico 
debarge he large and got a lack in the garage 
Few parts here and there I declare hard my lawd
One at Clark one at spelman 
Both know each other and it's cool you can tell when 
he step off in the party women jump for joy 
But all the wild niggaz scheming they gon' jump the boy
for spittin all that bourgeoisie my watch my car
I'm a star I'd rather be a comet by far
