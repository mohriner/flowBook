Yo, I control the stadium like the law long arm
Warn, ring the alarm, cause here The Roots come
The funk's all ready for whoever want some
Your album get split like, a lump sum
No doubt, under this influencin of outcome
Millenium spaceship, totally wasted
Schoolly D classic, though I vocally laced it
Taste this swerve on a regular basis
Servin y'all whatever the place is
Blowin conniseur quality in my competitor's faces
This is without doubt, your lady pass out
This Illa Fifth Twilight Zone, you ass out
Shout, to my brothers on back route
Whippin the short that's smacked out, dig it
Strump this in your casette deck, hip-hop has not left yet
I sent a verse in the mail like, a death threat
The critically acclaimed composer, stand over
Whichever mute miniscule mic holder
You never knew the real before, yo I show ya
You need to make your thoughts more sober, think it over
