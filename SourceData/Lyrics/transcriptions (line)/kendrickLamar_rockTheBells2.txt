look into the new vision in mind the kendrick divine intervention 
i drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten 
dont chime in my business youll run into atomic collision 
you knew my colonic was different im shitting on shit 
that was shifting your image i rhyme like a chemist 
i rhyme like the guinness book of records was records i written 
i rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that i didn't like when i did it 
you bit it your bite was so big you need bridges at night can admit it 
the pint the hennessy spiked this minute a mic and 
a menace behind it and time is dependent on what you pretending to be 
your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace 
the preach i'm finding my soul on this beat defining my flow 
and you know i fold any foe at defeat its four in the morning 
forming a george foreman that's a grill when i speak and i'm on it 
till the mill in the jeep then living orders i feel like a feets 
of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches i see when recording sheesh
