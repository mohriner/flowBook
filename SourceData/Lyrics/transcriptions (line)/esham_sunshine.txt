My life in the sunshine The sun don't shine too much on mine 
But I feel funny ways 
on sunny days Honey plays, 
money pays, but must I keep her in a daze 
Used to be my baby 
But now you're just a Bay Bay Kid 
And I'm thinking about the things I did Just to make you happy 
scooping the scrappy, but listen to the nappy pappy 
It's all about money It's all about mo' money 
and it's gettin mo' funny In the sunny days 
I think about my wicked ways 
Juice has got me crazed so crime pays 
Putting in work doing my dirt 
And I'm the one that ends up getting hurt 
Just for a piece of puss, a piece of bush 
And now the next man's getting the tush 
I guess I'll know next time 
But for now I'm just losing my mind Cause I'm caught up in the sunshine
