why y'all complain about o gees 
i don't look at a legend and say you owe me 
not snoop not dre not ice cube 
i don't care me and quik went to the same school 
i look in the mirror and do it myself 
like a self made nigga i don't need a maid nigga 
do i need a cosign from dre or jigga 
they can make me much bigger but do i need em though 
i just need a flow the type of shit 
that make you think you seen pac ghost 
me against the world on you mothafuckas 
i got my back against the wall 
and a forty five dog get smoked chris tucker 
uhh tryna record my steelo 
even when i'm not there just like tivo 
the hoes tell me that i got a real big ego 
and weed move slow right now but e go 
you know what i'm talking bout i look at your audemars 
to put y'all on time out it's time to unveil the real 
and your career is bout as frail as miss winehouse 
just salute grab a flute and pull the wine out 
ooh ooh ooh just like that
