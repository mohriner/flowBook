Might find your man dead in the ocean
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
but it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the eight and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
Cuz my shells is expensive You'll know exactly why
when you yellin in intensive my fellas is offensive
Lucky cuz I got guns that crack your back
but that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack
and, niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel
but we know how to bid so y'all go head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home Eatin right,
gettin good rest either on the far or the foam
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here
and, y'all just talkin, I'm doin it well
Jadakiss mother fucker I'ma see you in hell, what
