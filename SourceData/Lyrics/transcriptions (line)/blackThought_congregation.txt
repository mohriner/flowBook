I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, going overboard like the Amistad
Ringing bells, it was twenty twelve back in ninety five
I made it out alive, now finally I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's sticking to it like, mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginners luck
If you denying the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial descent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I wasn't listening to that intuition 
now I'm in that system again
And I'm praying God give me the strength
I'm drifting into a dark place, tryna keep this part of my heart safe
My soul basically been shark bait, my body's in bad shape
