to be continued lets see whats next up on the menu 
run up in you lyrics that be fuckin with you 
in the mental pick any mental 
instru funda detri extra extra large 
like the borough of brooklyn the residential 
existentialist specialist like sly stone 
wit my poem and fly song 
ride along with cats who live great and die strong 
word we gonna rock till nothin else matters 
yall catch bodies we catch excellent cadavers 
your next of kin an shatter stories splattered in the tabloids 
erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we peppermint altoids 
step in the high reppin the spot called flatbush 
whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust 
the abstract then becomes the reality 
alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity
