you all comfy when shit is paid up like the car note or your rent 
look out you broke and now you got more hustle than larry flynt 
diggin up dirt on politicians when you got no pot to piss in 
sellin watches for commission with fake rocks that dont glistin 
holdin up a block position been a lot of options you 
to get in stop the bitchin you just aint makin no hot decisions
where the blood clot look how many gold diggers the clubs got 
if you aint up on the hustle find yourself doin the bus stop 
or the train station with the change waitin for a metro card 
petrified cuz once you get the dough to let go is hard 
im a vet though and its odd to see these new cats splurgin 
industry virgins think money make em a better person 
sign to ya mans label which is under a label under a parent label 
apparently you aint even able to sit down at the table 
you aint braggin about seein the dough you braggin about bein a ho 
dont be mad at me be mad atcha boys i just thought you needed to know
