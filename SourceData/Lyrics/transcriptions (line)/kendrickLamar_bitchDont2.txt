i'm tryin' to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love 
you're tryin' to keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does 
and i'm lookin' right past you we live in a world we live in a world 
on two different axles you live in a world you livin' behind the mirror 
i know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior 
this shit is vital i know you had to this shit is vital i know you had
die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable 
give me a feasible gain rather a seasonal name i'll let the people know 
this is somethin' you can blame on yourselves you can remain stuck in a box 
i'ma break out and then hide every lock i'ma break out and then hide every lock 
i can feel the changes i can feel the new people around me 
just want to be famous you can see that my city found me 
then put me on stages to me that's amazing 
to you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this say this say
