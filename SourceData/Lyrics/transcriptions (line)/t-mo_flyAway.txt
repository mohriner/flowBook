There's a ghetto in every city Politicians slangin slurs, 
high from the natural herb Ain't no runnin from niggaz 
Everywhere you go, drinkin alcohol Ready to call 
Earl, it's your world, black man Them devils can't stand 
how we makin moves, smooth Avoidin legal hassles 
goin unseen like the hand that took 
then documented it in his book how these niggaz shook the world with the hook 
Now they back like Jack in that red Cadillac
