I say fuck the police thats how I treat em 
We buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom 
Well buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em 
Things we buy to cover up what's inside 
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth 
That's why shorties holler where the ballers at 
Drug dealer buy Jordans crackhead buy crack 
And a white man get paid off of all of that 
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou 
Cause fuck it I went to Jacob with twenty five thou 
Before I had a house and I'd do it again 
Cause I wanna be on one oh six and Park pushing a Benz 
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific 
I got a couple past due bills I won't get specific 
I got a problem with spending before I get it 
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
