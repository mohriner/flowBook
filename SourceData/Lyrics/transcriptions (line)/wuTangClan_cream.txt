I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had second hands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth rocking the gold tooth, Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with
this one and that one Pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolies at sixteen
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in em vee pees every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine or here go the tech nine
Ch chick POW, move from the gate now
