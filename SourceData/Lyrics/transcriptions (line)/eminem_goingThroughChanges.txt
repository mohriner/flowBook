LATELY I REALLY FEEL LIKE IM ROLLING FOR DOUGH LIKE PHILLY
I FEEL LIKE IM LOSING CONTROL OF MYSELF I SINCERELY 
APOLOGIZE IF ALL THAT I SOUND LIKE IS IM COMPLAINING 
BUT LIFE KEEPS ON COMPLICATING AN 
IM DEBATING ON LEAVING THIS WORLD THIS EVENING
EVEN MY GIRLS CAN SEE IM GRIEVIN I TRY AND HIDE IT
BUT I CANT WHY DO I ACT LIKE IM ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY 
WHEN INSIDE IM DYING I AM FINALLY REALIZING I NEED HELP
CANT DO IT MYSELF TOO WEAK 
TWO WEEKS IVE BEEN HAVING UPS AND DOWNS GOING THROUGH PEAKS AND VALLEYS 
DILLY DALLYING AROUND WITH THE IDEA 
OF ENDING THE SHIT RIGHT HERE
IM HATIN MY REFLECTION I WALK AROUND THE HOUSE TRYIN TO FIGHT MIRRORS
I CANT STAND WHAT I LOOK LIKE YEAH I LOOK FAT 
BUT WHAT DO I CARE I GIVE A FUCK 
ONLY THING I FEAR IS HAILIE IM AFRAID IF I CLOSE MY EYES I MIGHT SEE HER SHIT
