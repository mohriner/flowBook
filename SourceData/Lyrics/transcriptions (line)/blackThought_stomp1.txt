Speaking of pieces of a man 
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand 
It reads like a final letter I'm leaving for my fam 
but It's written in language they will never understand
A late repentant Never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned 
The Wheels spin I'm looking for a sacrificial lamb 
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan 
Listen Was this a matter of flesh and blood Yes it was 
Does it matter who win and lose Yes it does 
It ain't about the most blessid love 
When you return to the essence What is it back to the essence of 
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of 
Cause you was fake and never measured up 
You just a nigga on his regular But how far am I ahead of ya
It just as easily coulda been me instead of ya
