Yo, I had a queen named Amina, height five seven
Caramel complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man, Big Vince
Like something from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brother, I call her my sugar sister
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flipping the script
Like, "Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep trying to hit I could quit speaking
Tariq in fact, you bein Black Thought don't get you closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed to
Most of them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flavor
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya"
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffing
Steady pursuing screwing, getting nothing but the silent treatment
