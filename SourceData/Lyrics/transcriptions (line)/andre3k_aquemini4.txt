My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten 
meet the twin andre Ben welcome to the lion's den 
original skin many men comprehend 
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend 
Sin all depends on what you believing in 
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren 
alien can blend right on in wit yo' kin 
look again cuz I swear I spot one every now and then 
It's happening again wish I could tell you when 
andre this is andre y'all just gon' have to make amends
