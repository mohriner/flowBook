Me and everything around me is unstable like chernobyl 
ready to go at any moment jumpin like a pogo stick 
Life never lived up to my expectations 
so I accept the patience expect the worse but now I'm pacin back and 
forth inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches 
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences 
I had the best of life in my clinches but monkey wrenches
was thrown Like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem too long 
I fall asleep before the endin don't even get to say 
amen I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times I think I'm crazy so I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like riddick 
Bowe I've been fighting this since them fetus days 
I count from one to twenty when I'm through repeat the phrase 
It's just a phase it's gon all pass but that gets old too 
I'm weakening like a deacon doin dirt What am I supposed to do
