I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to
those who deserve it And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby
