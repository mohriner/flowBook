i thought i fell in love once with a girl who love blunts 
and got fronts and she made me rise above lust 
i thought i fell in love again with this one chick 
body so thick it was hard not 
i fell in love just one more time after that 
shorty had me ready to settle down and make a habitat 
the sad fact is i wasnt ready to give up my freedom 
and so i let them go pretending that i dont need em 
so here i sit at the bar amongst the star gazers 
caught in the crosshairs a target of a heart breaker 
the radio was playing neither one of us by gladys 
its so ironic i chuckled 
i reminisce on all the chicks that i ran thru 
now im dealing with this black magic one man who
stringing me along like the guitar on the song im rapping on 
i aint do the math a libra and a capricorn
