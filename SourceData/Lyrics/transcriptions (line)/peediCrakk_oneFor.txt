It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People wanna know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang
Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thring
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they watch your mother
Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't blink
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow
Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest Your stupid ass get, clapped,
bap About my past and my future,
you disrespect it, I'll shoot you Treat it just like that...
