these conditions make us strong and we create our own 
businesses so later on our children have things in they 
name that they can say they own a mix tape freestyle 
become your favorite song no place like home 
when the cops ask you about your neighbors 
beat on you threaten to incarcerate you till you spill your guts like you a garcia vega 
we roll blunts not the papers cop the greatest 
take it coast to coast l a to chicago like smooth operators 
cop the dro and cop the blacks cop the four cock it back 
drop the flow or rock a hat on top a stocking cap
be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that 
youll finish school but when you got a dream you gotta follow that 
and make sure when you make it out the hood you always holler back 
think about what you got from that and always put your dollars back 
on top of that this is a legacy and we a part of that 
the hood is where my heart is at catch me around my way
