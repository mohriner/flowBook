the spirit in the 
sky scream homicide But it was time to ride
on some niggas funny talking If too much money talking 
We make em economize Real rap no
tale spinning such is the life of a 
kamikaze pilot We wyling out of control
until we all make the funny papers like Comic Con 
Feared in all streets so if you ever see me 
out in y'all streets Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away I wish a nigga could 
Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest 
But once you've had the best better ain't as good 
Weak heartedness cannot be involved 
Stick to the script nigga fuck your improv 
Like the samurai The street's Hammurabi Code 
Play your part shut the fuck up and do as I was told
