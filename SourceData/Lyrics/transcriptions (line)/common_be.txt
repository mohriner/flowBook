i want to be as free as the spirits of those who left i'm talking
malcolm coltrane my man yusef through 
death grew conception new breath and resurrection
for moms new steps in her direction in the right way 
told inside is where the fight lay and 
evry thing a nigga do may not be what he might say
chicago nights stay stay on the mind 
but i write many lives they lay on these lines 
wave the signs of the times many say the grinds on the mind 
shorties blunted out and evry one wanna rhyme 
bush pushing lies killers immortalized 
we got arms but won't reach for the skies 
waiting for the lord to rise i look into my daughters eyes 
and realize ima learn through her 
the messiah might even return through her 
if ima do it i gotta change the world through her
furs and a benz gramps wanting em demons and 
old friends pops they hauntin em 
the chosen one from the land of the frozen sun 
where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones 
walk like warriors we were never told to run 
explored the world to return to where my soul begun
never looking back or too far in front of me 
the present is a gift and i just wanna be
