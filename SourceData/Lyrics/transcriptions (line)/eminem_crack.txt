BACK WIT ANDRE THE GIANT MISTER ELEPHANT TUSK
PICTURE US YOU'LL JUST BE ANOTHER ONE BIT THE DUST
JUST ONE OF MY MOTHERS SONS WHO GOT THROWN UNDER THE BUS
KISS MY BUTT LICK THE FUMUNDA CHEESE FROM UNDER MY NUTS
IT DISGUSTS ME TO SEE THE GAME THE WAY THAT IT LOOKS
ITS A MUST I REDEEM MY NAME AND HATERS GET MUSHED
BITCHES LUST MAN THEY LOVE ME WHEN I LAY IN THE CUT
FIST THE CUP THE LADY GAVE HER EIGHTY SOME PAPER CUT
NOW PICTURE US ITS RIDICULOUS YOU CURSE AT THE THOUGHT
CUZ WHEN I SPIT THE VERSE THE SHIT GETS WORSE THEN WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE
IF I COULD FIT THE WORDS AS PICTURE PERFECT WORKS EVERY TIME
EVERY VERSE EVERY LINE AS SIMPLE AS NURSERY RHYMES
ITS ELEMENTARY THE ELEPHANTS HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM
I VENTURE TO SAY WERE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION ITS TRUE
NOT TO MENTION BACK WITH A VENGEANCE SO HERE'S THE SIGNAL
OF THE BAT SYMBOL THE PLATINUM TRIO'S BACK ON YOU HOES
