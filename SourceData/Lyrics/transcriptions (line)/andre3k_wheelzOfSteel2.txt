The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cuz we don't sell dope that you 
distribute we don't contribute to your clandestine activity
my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow 
But so is cod liver oil 
You went behind my back like bluto when he cut up olive Oil 
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil
boa constricted on my soul that they call
