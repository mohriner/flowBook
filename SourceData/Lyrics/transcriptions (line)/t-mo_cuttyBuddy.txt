Now when I saw you in the club, all I did was stare
Intimidated by my golds and my long ass hair
But I couldn't let you pass, and didn't even care
I had to make conversation, and let you know this here
Who am I, the well known T Mo, represent the G Mo B
Trinity to infinity Baby whats your name, where you came from
Where you get your game from, I bet you learned a lot growing up
Being a cute lil' thang, like to bang 
with the big dogs Roll in the big hogs, 
eighteen, living life raw
Little shawty was a dream
Had to put up my dream my brother had
