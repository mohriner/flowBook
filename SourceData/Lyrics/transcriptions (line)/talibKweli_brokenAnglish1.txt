crunch i know the natti with you brooklyn hold it down 
peep how we terrorize these niggas through sound 
wanna battle compound its how we do 
nobody out there can fuck with my crew 
johnson know what im talking about 
dante know what im talking about 
main flow know what im talking about 
hi tek i know you know what im talking about 
wanna battle way of the gun will bust with you 
play it to the bone like gristle im straight official 
federal like long prison time ohio give you 
hop on the johnson track rip it to thistles 
like my nigga e dub yeah we love the street buzz 
cats in the game acting soft like peach fuzz 
delete dubs carry my voice through queen city 
with stories that make the horrible seem pretty yeah 
niggas is proctor and gambling with they life 
i take my anger and handle it and channel it through the mic 
spray the area complex like the inferior one that you get 
when you standing to close to the sun 
its like ra pum pa pum beat the drum like a man 
you get burned quick trying to enter my atmosphere 
this aint practice here this the money shot for the game 
i know i rocked your brain when your honey dropped the name 
get for asking stupid questions like whos the best you ever had 
dont be mad these are skills you never had and never will 
me and my niggas forever build 
before this shit get too hot you better chill for real 
deal with kweli and crunch extraordinary 
you aint heard no shit like this we pop cherries on virgin ears 
remember you heard it hear first 
got a taste for blood i quench my thirst with the verse
