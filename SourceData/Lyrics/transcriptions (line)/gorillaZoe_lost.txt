Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world A labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be no
I ask them no questions They give me no answers
Following the wise But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away But I still have no answers
