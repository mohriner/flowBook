sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself 
what i'm scared of how dare the media portray me this way 
i can hear the crowd screaming the weirdest of chants 
they all in my era artist of era role model i can't 
it's like i'm a parrot apparently i'm marking the dance 
i seen done with the devil such a ghetto romance 
how many niggas fall victim looking at you trapped in the system 
mentally they kept you in prison and you won't get out no one visit 
open up your mouth no one listen you in denial nigga 
i'm in denial with you i dial dead homies numbers off this liquor 
time and time again i find myself inside the cerebellum 
of several felons orion's belt couldn't live in my world 
i seen tigers lions let loose and spooked i'm next door to earl 
i guess i rely on jesus to save us 
before i refer the madness my neighbors witness ski masks 
the masses don't know i'm packing this four and harassing your ho 
antagonizing the business you love the most 
see the difference to my approach is a forty ounce at the store 
if a forty bounce to get no i never learn i'm hard headed 
the corporate world don't like it but i said it
