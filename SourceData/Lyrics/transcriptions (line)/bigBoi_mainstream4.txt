Everybody's a player rubbing them Kangols on their head 
Thinking its all about your clothes nigga its all about your self 
The way you feel about your life the times that you done shared with 
Your friends and family up and down like hoes give head 
To dicks oh six serving them in the mix but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh what you want me to call you slut but why you 
fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts 
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut every month looking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even 
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven 
In the mainstream home team banging them with these hits 
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish
