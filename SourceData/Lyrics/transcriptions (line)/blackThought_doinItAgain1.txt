Remix rising up out of the flames like a phoenix 
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius 
Knowing I'm sowing seeds let's see whose thumb is the greenest 
If I said it I mean it I did it because I need it 
Eat sleep it or bleed it write it down and then read it 
Asphalt to the cement your trash talk deleted 
I blast off then lay em out like a Tempurpedic 
It's Black Thought for certain I'mma win evenchuhly 
This unsung underrated under appreciated 
The one them underachievers had underestimated 
Finely graduated from one of the most hated 
To something that's so sacred nobody gonna take it 
Face it I keep doin' it well Doin' it sans assistance 
just do it yourself Doin' it below the radar 
we doin' it stealth Doin' it again for Illadelph
yo who else We gonna do it again
