I slung slang When i came in the do
I told you before you never know what i know my
Name oh no I'm missin' you
baby, my pro black flow
Strange but thats how i walk it Slangs how i talk it
If it don't chart mother fuck it
How do niggas know that it's me when i come
Cos' one hands on my nuts and the others on my gun nuf
Bic lights flick when my vocal tracks lit
Get so mad over it, that they'll kill for this shit
I gets projects respect from east and west
Hip Hop's like this no matter where niggas rest
Recognize post its You know i represent
hard core ex slaves Under white governments
Every hard job can't left undone
Before you splurt gun or ya bust pon'
