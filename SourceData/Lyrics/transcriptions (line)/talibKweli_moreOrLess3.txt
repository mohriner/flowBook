more natural the less conscious at the same time 
the more i bomb shit the less a devils got a grip 
i get it loose we gotta slip away the ghetto gotta get 
more for a dollar more fresh goods for purchase 
less liquor stores less churches that be looking like 
corner stores more rap songs that stress purpose 
with less misogyny and less curses 
lets put more depth in our verses til they left on the surface 
while we stomp through the underground the calm dont come around 
you sort of hoping for that reflection you sort of open 
im a heed the call em chosen i dont play with your emotion 
stop acting so god damn emotional 
i give you these bars for free like its promotional 
this aint no marketing strategy 
it had to be from the heart in order to be reality reflection
