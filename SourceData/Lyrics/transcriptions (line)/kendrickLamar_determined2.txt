what i gotta do in order to see success 
having the worlds best to call me the best 
pull up at the grammy awards as best dressed 
with an address next to a beautiful actress 
do i gotta run in your spot and start blasting 
better yet rob the nearest nick check cashing 
ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly bragging 
catch him at the light snatch him out his jeep wagon 
or maybe i gotta hook up with jose 
cop five bricks of the yay head to the bay 
area or carry the birds to v a 
let the clips distribute the work all day 
day then come back home 
every three weeks flip three to six zones 
homies on the block can say whatever they want 
i don't wanna be a dealer i wanna be a trump
