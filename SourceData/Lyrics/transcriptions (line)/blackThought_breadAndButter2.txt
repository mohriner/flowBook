A child is born his mother is gone 
He in the middle of it literally tussling strong for his life 
the tide high in the eye of the storm 
A mannish boy arrive and the riot is on 
With no spare time to try to respond or prepare times 
it's hard not becoming a headline 
Or praying in the night when it's bedtime Or laying your head down 
Cuz you already know what it is now 
You know a lot of leaders ain't honest And they can't keep a promise 
And I hate to speak about it but it's all freakanomics 
Cramped and proud of it you amped and you rowdy
Treading water tryna lift up your head without drowning 
This type of shit can make your heart stop pounding 
But you pushing for the top too scared to stop Now it gets deep 
bodies are floating around in the streets 
Lot of people who won't even be around in a week 
Man get the operation gone what y'all waiting on 
We been patient y'all motherfuckers taking long 
The television getting all the information wrong 
Doing how they do it getting they miseducation on 
They already late Somebody been was sposed to regulate 
Instead of wait before they let the levee break 
You try running from the truth but it's giving chase 
I got to ask myself yo is any nigga safe
