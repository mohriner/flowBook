When you on the corners is too much drama 
Livin with the police right behind ya 
It's always more than a slight reminder
We livin in a war zone like Rwanda 
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father 
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother 
Whatever don't break me a make me stronger 
I feel like I can't take too much longer 
It's too much lyin and too much cryin 
I'm all cried out cuz I grew up cryin 
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin
They tryin to convince me that I ain't tryin 
We uninspired we unadmired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired 
of livin in the hood where the shots are fired
We dyin to live so to live we dyin You just like I am
