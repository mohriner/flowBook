Somebody told me that this planet was small we use to live in the same building 
on the same floor and never met before 
until I'm overseas on tour and peep this ethiopian queen 
from philly taking classes abroad 
she studying film and photo flash focus record 
said she workin on a flick and could my click do the score
she said she loved my show in paris at Elysee Montmartre
and that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that things fall apart, intentions shatter 
she like that shit don't matter when I get home get at her 
through letter, phone, whatever let's link, let's get together 
shit you think not, like I went home and forgot
time passed, we back in philly now she up in my spa
tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
now she rocking shit like Jill Scott and keep tellin me tell
