Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals 
of a prisoner on his way Trapped inside your desire to 
fire bullets that stray Track a tire just tell you 
I'm tired and ran away I should ask a choir what do you 
require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith 
As the record spin I should pray for the record I recognize
that I'm easily prey I got ate alive yesterday I got 
animosity building It's probly big as a building Me 
jumping off of the roof Is just me playing it safe 
But what am I sposed to do when the topic is red or blue 
And you understand that I ain't but know I'm accustomed to 
Just a couple that look for trouble And live in the street with rank 
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study 
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face 
From a function that tooken place They was wondering if I bang 
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks I don't mind
because one day you respect The good kid mad city
