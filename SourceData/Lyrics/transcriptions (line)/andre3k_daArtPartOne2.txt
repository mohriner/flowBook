Now suzy Screw had a partna named sasha 
thumper I remember her number like the
summer when her and suzy yeah they threw a slumber
party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer 
well it was more like spend the night Three in the morning 
yawnin dancin under street lights We chillin like a 
villain and a nigga feelin right in the middle of the 
ghetto on the curb but in spite all of the 
bullshit we on our back starin at the stars above 
talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up 
I said what you wanna be she said alive 
It made me think for a minute then looked in her eyes
I coulda died time went on I got grown 
Rhyme got strong mind got blown I came back 
home to find lil sasha was gone 
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treatin her wrong
I kept on singin my song and hopin at a show 
that I would one day see her standin in the front row 
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm baby two months due sasha thumper
