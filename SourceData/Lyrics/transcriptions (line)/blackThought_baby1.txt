Your ma don't like to jitterbug 
said this unholy music 
Hip hop just so ridiculous 
evrything sounds so confusing 
Nowadays ain't nothing like it was 
one thing that showed the blues is 
this system so mysterious 
can't let that stop the movement 
Can't get no satisfaction 
they all laughing glad it's happening 
All ringside for the main attraction 
Acting a fool with a lust for action 
Young girl caught in a crime of passion 
Sitting there crying in designer fashion 
Didn't blow didn't have time for asking 
Somebody call for the ambulances girl
