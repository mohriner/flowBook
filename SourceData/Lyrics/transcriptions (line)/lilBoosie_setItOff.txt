They call me Bad Ass, and I'll punish you
You ain't my equal, we ain't people I ain't one of you
Since ninety eight I grabbed my plate up off the lunch table
I told momma I'm thuggin outside, we don't need cable
Now I'm the nipples on the titty, I'm the motor called a hemi
I'm the V twelve in that seven sixty, you niggas bitches
We real niggas with G codes We love to go in beast mode
We thuggin, we all got bread so if we fall we the crutches
We the do do in the dutches I'm the photo in the camera,
I'm the pistol when it snap ya I got the sickest
Beamer I got the sickest Magnum I got the sickest
Charger yalls thirty mines forty I told you niggas
Webbie and Me, for you get stretched in the streets
This the day that you gon be deceased, for playin with a beast
I told Turk take off my collar I'm finna take it there
You niggas ain't play at my projects, y'all played at the fair
Trill Entertainment that's my thugs there there's love there
D.A. don't search my house cause ain't no motherfuckin drugs there
We smart with this shit, we got retarded with this shit
deuce, deuce up in my shoe I set it off up in this bitch, nigga
