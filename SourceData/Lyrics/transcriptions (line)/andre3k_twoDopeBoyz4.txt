Yeah tight like nuts and bolts sluts and hoes that get evicted
I'm dealin wit Queens in my castle aint worth to risk it 
Now tricks be lookin at me like I'm they way up out the projects 
Can't put you on my payroll and no I ain't got no rolex or no 
diamond at the exit with a sign sayin We'll rap for food 
My face is bawled up cuz I ain't in a happy mood 
While my partner got the squeegee and the windex 
Cuz somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax
error bring the terror to your dome like P E
Prone to finish this out cuz this be a free style
