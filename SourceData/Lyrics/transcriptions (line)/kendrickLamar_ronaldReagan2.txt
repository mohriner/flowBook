let's hit the county building gotta cash my check 
spend it all on a forty ounce to the neck 
and in retrospect i remember december being the hottest 
squad cars neighborhood wars and stolen mazdas 
i tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics 
up and down get a six four better know how to drive it 
i'm driving on e with no license or registration 
heart racing racing pass johnny because he's racist 
nineteen eighty seven the children of ronald reagan 
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch 
he blowing on stress hoping that ease the stress 
he copping some blow hoping that it can stretch 
newborn massacre hopping out the passenger 
with calendars cause your date coming 
run him down and then he gun him down i'm hoping that you fast enough 
even the legs of michael johnson don't mean nothing 
because compton crip niggas ain't nothing to fuck with 
bompton pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with 
compton essays ain't nothin' to fuck with 
but they fuck with me and bitch i love it woop de woop woop de
