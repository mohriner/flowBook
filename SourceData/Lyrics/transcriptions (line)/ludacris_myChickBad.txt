I'm sayin' my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My chick do stuff that I can't even put in words
Her swagger don't stop, her body won't quit
So fool pipe down, you ain't talkin bout shit
my chick bad, tell me if you seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena
All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body lookin like milk
No no time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell yo' chick to go home
