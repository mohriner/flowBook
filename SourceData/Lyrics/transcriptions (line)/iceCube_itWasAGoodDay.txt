Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinking will I live another twenty four
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright I got a
beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm asking y'all
Which park are y'all playing basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M J
I can't believe today was a good day
