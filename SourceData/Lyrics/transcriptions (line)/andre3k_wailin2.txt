I felt the pressure like sun shinin while raining 
at the same time I kept on rhymin not complainin 
storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your daisy Dukes I'm hazardous to all you Boss Hogs 
And roscoe P. Col' people who could boost my locomotive 
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed ta
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I 
compose won't y'all get sick of that cause I know I do when I hear those 
Flows that ain't hip hop you find that shit in the gift shop 
but to each his own my speech is gon' keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy even if you just 
hate my fuckin guts go ahead and dap me 
Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo' ass later
Cause we might need you in this war I'm wailin on you traitors Like that
