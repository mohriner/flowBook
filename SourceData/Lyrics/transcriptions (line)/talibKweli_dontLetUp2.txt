my man planet asia already broke down the science to my name 
speak to the silent and the tame and the violent in the brain thats right 
im the pilot in the plane im still sound bombing shit 
dominant when i be flowin cats get broken like promises 
fuck the politics my partnership with artists who 
put they heart in it thats why my crew spit the hardest shit 
for the art of it we start the shit and get it hype
cuz hearing me and this man here rock together yo its like 
mixing northern lights from the bay with yard weed from jamaica 
or the best from the knicks with the best of the lakers 
we the creators never the imitators of the slave traders 
all yall niggas is just cartoons put to music like fantasia 
from the planet of brooklyn to planet asia 
ill pull your card im all around i see your hand plus ill raise ya 
like children just for the sake of smacking you when you outta place 
you dont get hits niggas make errors try to run home you out at the plate youre out 
i make wack niggas light my l then i put it out on they face 
from new york to california ill run you all out of the state of mind you currently residin 
in the difference is you try to win 
you believe what they sayin you on your knees like you prayin 
you aint got to sweat the nice money aint no need to promise me 
with one rhyme i probably could break down your whole psychology 
niggas is hollywood like the church of scientology 
if i drop african thought they probably would lie and say its greek philosophy
