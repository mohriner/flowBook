SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL LIKE MY FATHER I HATE TO BE BOTHERED
WITH ALL OF THIS NONSENSE IT'S CONSTANT
AND OH IT'S HIS LYRICAL CONTENT THE SONG GUILTY CONSCIENCE 
HAS GOTTEN SUCH ROTTEN RESPONSES 
AND ALL OF THIS CONTROVERSY CIRCLES ME
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE MEDIA IMMEDIATELY
POINTS A FINGER AT ME 
SO I POINT ONE BACK AT EM BUT NOT THE INDEX OR PINKIE
OR THE RING OR THE THUMB IT'S THE ONE YOU PUT UP
WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHEN YOU WON'T JUST PUT UP
WITH THE BULLSHIT THEY PULL CAUSE THEY FULL OF SHIT TOO
WHEN A DUDES GETTIN BULLIED AND SHOOTS UP HIS SCHOOL
AND THEY BLAME IT ON MARILYN AND THE HEROIN
WHERE WERE THE PARENTS AT AND LOOK WHERE IT'S AT
MIDDLE AMERICA NOW IT'S A TRAGEDY
NOW IT'S SO SAD TO SEE AN UPPER CLASS CITY
HAVING THIS HAPPENING
THEN ATTACK EMINEM CAUSE I RAP THIS WAY
BUT I'M GLAD CAUSE THEY FEED ME THE FUEL THAT I NEED FOR THE FIRE
TO BURN AND IT'S BURNING AND I HAVE RETURNED
