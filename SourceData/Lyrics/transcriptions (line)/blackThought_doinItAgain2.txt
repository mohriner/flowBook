Yeah aiyyo I'm on a job see my eyes focussed where the prize be 
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot 
Just like Pac when they got him in the lobby 
Try to tax you'll find me like Ronald Isley 
I is a changed man hanging with fans are problies 
Niggas used to know me they don't even recognize me 
Yep the p five d is who the repertoire be 
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby 
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney 
The diffrence is I give it evrything inside me 
Dear dyry the fans still swear by me 
Even though I'm Late Night now like here's johnny
Swimming with them Great Whites now that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me 
Forever grimey I guess it's just Philly shining 
Rock roller bipolar like Phyllis Hyman
