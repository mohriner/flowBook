Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it but them bros ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I'm balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start
