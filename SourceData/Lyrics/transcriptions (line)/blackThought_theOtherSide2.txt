Yo we did this in remembrance of 
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of 
Carrying cold blooded hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough 
World travelers that seen it all and did enough 
Only to return to learn the world wasn't big enough 
Damn how long has it been I guess the jig is up 
Now all I know is I'm about to wake this nigga up 
Yeah that hindsight twenty twenty now 
niggas dead on the money tryna take something from me 
it's a wrap like a mummy Un done I am becoming 
and when he's tired of running Through the layers of the onion 
He'll probly shed a tear cause they'll be no more fast times 
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why 
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by
