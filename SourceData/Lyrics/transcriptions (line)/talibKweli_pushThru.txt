when you a man action is whats expected nothing is spoken on 
producer never got time for no excuses you gotta go beyond 
my flow is tom foolery i smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie 
i beautifully exude the vibe thats free of ambiguity 
ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me 
its coonery its lunacy lets make it plain 
only way that you hang is attached to a tree 
the moon talk to the sea and speak the body languages fluently 
she make it rain when im on fire she always try to douse me 
only reason that you make it rain is cause your diamonds cloudy 
i see you from a mile away when it get overcast 
old people feel it in they bones invade your home like i broke the glass 
and let myself in fighting for freedom 
like the people in tunisia spread through sudan and egypt 
this the music for the movement the score to your achievements 
never join em so you gotta beat em its carpe diem hey
