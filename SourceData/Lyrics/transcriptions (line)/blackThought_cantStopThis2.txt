they can't stop this I want my peoples to rock this 
Bang this music in your speakers and boxes 
Langston Hughes is bout as deep as my thoughts is 
Sit back and I'mma paint you a portrait Disgust can make you 
think that you had lost This shit can have you exhausted
Just picture the planet and imagine it's yours kid 
Don't ever let nobody knock you outta your orbit 
I never seen a bridge we couldn't shuffle across it 
We got a lotta people livin' a life that's pure trivia 
Real hip hop and they tryna get rid of ya 
Can't have that because here come the city of Philly 
Put an end to all the trivia really 
Where I'm walkin' evrybody ain't pretty or friendly 
It's work my whole life they ain't give me a penny 
Comin' up between a rock and a hard watching for God
People hip hopping with no option at all
