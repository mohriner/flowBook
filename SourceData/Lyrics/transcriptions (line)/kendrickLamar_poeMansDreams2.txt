you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga 
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya 
i like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya 
be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya 
i'm twenty three with morals and plans of living cordial 
not rich but wealthy there's nothing you can tell me 
my killings are not remorseful the city got my back 
for that i give them my torso you think about it 
and don't call me lyrical 
cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual 
i know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve 
my simplest shit be more pivotal 
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals 
worrisome individuals that live life critical 
so won't you bear witness while i bare feet 
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me 
but anyway this for my pops 
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot 
on wanna be heard probably thought he worked my nerves 
but really he was stressing me getting what i deserved 
somebody said my name on the radio 
he ain't know i was ready for the world that minute 
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it 
he'll probably be out of work laid back while he smoke good
