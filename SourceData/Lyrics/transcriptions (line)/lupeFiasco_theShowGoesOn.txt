Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lying through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh, put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi Town made me That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my home boy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L U P the man, cuz, the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up
