see y'all don't understand me 
my plan b is to win ya hearts before i win a grammy 
kendrick lamar words like a sword in the hands 
of a spartan marching on rosecrans in compton 
you can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit 
i'm on point like period i've been there and gone before you get near it 
ooh wee that boy remind me of a young martin luther 
the way he piece up troopers then round up shooters like malcolm x did 
i stand for what i believe in 
family god and honor from chicago my daddy and my momma 
came to compton to accomplish one thing 
raise a king reign supreme named kendrick 
i ain't lying it stand for king and i am one 
my unborn son and grandson will live royal 
from the coochie to the soil the meek shall inherit the earth 
well i've had this world since birth feel the good kid's hunger 
the crips made strong the pirus made stronger 
muscle in my heart stare at the eyes of mozart then tell him 
i'm the genius do my dougie and grab my penis 
cause i means this with all my soul and you can't control greatness 
less you hating with the heart of satan but even that can't stop it 
nigga get out my wallet and put passion in your logic 
passion in your life the passion of my christ is in me 
and if you say it ain't you may offend me damn that boy good 
bright as thomas edison but gucci man hood 
he stood alone for so long prolonged his whole career but now he's here 
you can shoot shots or cheer cause i am
