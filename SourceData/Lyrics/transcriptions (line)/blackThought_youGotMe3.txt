That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering she trying to play you for the fool Black
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact

I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins and she like
