Uh, what you think a real nigga rap for? So I can roll around in a Rav four Never that
Cadillac pimped out, fish bowl, true vogues Fifteens, but I had to go and get two mo
Whassup, get buck, shake junt killa DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the edge of the rest to go flash up a bitch See how far these vegetables get us
Pour up, the show up, the focus The doors ain't typical when they get open, hold up
You ain't never been sky high Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four five times, no parachute Bungee jump for the loot Hock a loogie off the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin' You would think my whip dyke
Cadillac lac lac lac, Cadillac lac lac lac, too early for the hook
Not sure if it's the sawed off for the bass in the trunk That keep a nigga shook
Careful no crook, tell a bitch look How I work the wheel and the crisis
Police behind us my index was grinding her pussy like rhyme with no timin' I think I'm nicest of
all That's the way I feel, bitch!
Crawl Why you showing your grill, bitch?
We off Our way outta here, don't get lost
I come in peace from somewhere unique Have no fear, uh
