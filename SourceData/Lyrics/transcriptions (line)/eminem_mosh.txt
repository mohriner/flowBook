IMAGINE IT POURING ITS RAINING DOWN ON US
MOSH PITS OUTSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE
SOMEONES TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING MAYBE THIS IS GOD JUST SAYING
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MONSTER THIS COWARD 
THAT WE HAVE EMPOWERED THIS IS BIN LADEN 
LOOK AT HIS HEAD NODDING HOW COULD WE ALLOW 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITHOUT PUMPING OUR FIST NOW THIS IS 
OUR FINAL HOUR 
LET ME BE THE VOICE AND YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR CHOICE
LET ME SIMPLIFY THE RHYME JUST TO AMPLIFY THE NOISE
TRY TO AMPLIFY THE TIMES IT AND MULTIPLY IT BY SIX
TEEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE EQUAL OF THIS HIGH PITCH
MAYBE WE CAN REACH AL QUIDA THROUGH MY SPEECH
LET THE PRESIDENT ANSWER ON HIGH ANARCHY
STRAP HIM WITH A K FORTY SEVEN LET HIM GO
FIGHT HIS OWN WAR LET HIM IMPRESS DADDY THAT WAY
NO MORE BLOOD FOR OIL WE GOT OUR OWN BATTLES 
TO FIGHT ON OUR SOIL NO MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE 
TO TRICK US TO THINK THAT WE AINT LOYAL
IF WE DONT SERVE OUR OWN COUNTRY WERE PATRONIZING A HERO
LOOK IN HIS EYES ITS ALL LIES THE STARS AND STRIPES
THEYVE BEEN SWIPED WASHED OUT AND WIPED
AND REPLACED WITH HIS OWN FACE MOSH NOW OR DIE
IF I GET SNIPED TONIGHT YOULL KNOW WHY BECAUSE I TOLD YOU TO FIGHT
