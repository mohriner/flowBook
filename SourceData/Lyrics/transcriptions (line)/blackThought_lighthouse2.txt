After the love is lost 
Friendship dissolves and even blood is lost 
Where did it begin the way we did each other wrong 
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across

I'm not even breaking out in a sweat or cold fever 
but I'm never paying up on my debt or tolls either 
I'll leave the memories here I won't need them If I
