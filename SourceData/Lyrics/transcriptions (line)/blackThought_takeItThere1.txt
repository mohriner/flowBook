I'm from the side of town Where shots get sprayed around
So the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change about
Chain cigarette smoking with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smoking mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's emerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spilling this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use they mics than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom For real
