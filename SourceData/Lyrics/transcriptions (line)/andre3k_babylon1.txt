I came into this world high as a bird 
From second hand cocaine powder i know it sounds absurd I never tooted but its in my veins 
While the rest of the country bunjees off bridges without no snap back and bitches they say they 
need that To shake they fannies in the ass clubs 
they go the other route turn each other out burn each other out 
where a bonafide nigga like me can't even get no back rub these days 
ain't that bleak on they part 
but let me hold it down cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart now that's hard 
while we rantin and ravin bout gats 
nigga they made them gats they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at
