I done came down, hold up,
grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin to control her
She call me when she want a change,
black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline,
H Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm E Z tag like Peter Pan,
she want a man, don't need a man
I'm flyin down your boulevard
She cookin dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out,
yo bitch know what I'm talkin bout
Pulls up, pull out,
we get it poppin in the parkin lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm geed up, East up,
fossil pants, I'm hard as rock
