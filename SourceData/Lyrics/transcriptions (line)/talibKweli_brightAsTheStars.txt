a lotta cats like to get on the microphone and front 
they say they rollin in paper like they ran outta blunts 
tell ya how much they sound scan in a month 
if the man tell you to jump you do it we never let man take advantage of us 
you get props off the diamonds you rented 
i get my props off the rhymes i invented cuz i spoke my mind and i meant it 
like tae bo with a bow tie kicked your ass with class come on 
and we still take it to brooklyn when we ready to splash 
me and hi tek got you ready to blast im never ready to last
i stay hungry like im ready to fast 
married to the movement like im betty shabazz the rhyme veteran 
you actin real bitch right now like a lesbian thespian 
since they let me in the back 
ive been droppin jewels im plugged in like pasta news 
stay fresh and clean like hospitals in the war the cris poppers the wallet to wrist watches 
you ever think the wrist is watchin you thats why the cops stoppin you 
nigga please they can track you down 
anywhere your cell phone transmittin radiation through your ear
your two way is way too new and obsolete next year 
navigational system show you how to get there 
and you aint think about how you got here do you know where you are 
what happened today back in the day they used to follow the stars 
spillin so much you gotta catch it in bottles and jars 
and make emcees eat their words and swallow their bars oh my god
