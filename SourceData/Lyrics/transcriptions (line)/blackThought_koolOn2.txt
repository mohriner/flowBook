I'm never sleeping like I'm on methamphetamine 
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me 
Say my reputation precede me like a pedigree 
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies 
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places 
Cake by the layers Rich but never famous 
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless 
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike 
The minute before the storm hit is what I'm calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it's prom night 
It's suicide right pursuers tried like 
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I've got em waiting on the news like I'm Cronkite 
Not in the lime light or needed for crime right
No boasts just bodied and chalked close to the line tight
