I used to have
Peace, serenity, teaching divinity
Break bread, sipping the blood, eating with enemies
Blind, pearl on my mind thinking we finna be
This, that, and the third Boy did I learn, tables turn
Billy holiday burned down to play when my
nerves drowned my focus away Swerving in the
locomotive, far from my hopes and motives
Back to boastin' at shows to get a standin' oh
From all the fans I know on some of that Sapphire
rapid fire soul stuff I used to hit em off with
But now I'm some ol' pay the toll
for the way I played the role Cautious when I lace a flow, cause
Po's think I'm painting codes Patience grown thin,
home sick and haven't been home since
Fuck a rapper, I'm an actor in a film called
Leave me the fuck alone til' I find a real job
Busting chrome grills off at these soft hearted
break beats Bouncin' with eight oh eights and gray ink
Blue heart, red skies
True art died in the heart of my mind Kept trying to
fulfill this Blank script with realness,
even if it kills this Poet inside
