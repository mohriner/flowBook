IT USED TO BE TIME WHEN YOU COULD JUST SAY A RHYME
AND WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE DYING
BUT NOW IT'S ELEVATED CAUSE ONCE YOU PUT SOMEONE'S KIDS IN IT
SHIT GETS ESCALATED IT AIN'T JUST WORDS NO MORE IS IT
IT'S A DIFFERENT BALL GAME CALL NAMES AND YOU AIN'T JUST RAPPING
WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO STOP THE FIFTY AND JA BEEF FROM HAPPENING
ME AND DRE HAD SAT WITH HIM KICKED IT AND HAD A CHAT WITH HIM
AND ASKED HIM NOT TO START IT HE WASN'T GONNA GO AFTER HIM
UNTIL JA START GABBING IN MAGAZINES HOW HE STABBED HIM
FUCK IT FIFTY SMASH HIM MASH HIM AND LET HIM HAVE IT
MEANWHILE MY INTENTIONS PULLEY'D IN OTHER DIRECTIONS
SOME RECEPTIONIST SAID THE SOURCE WHO ANSWERS PHONES AT HIS DESK HAS AN ERECTION
FOR ME AND THINKS THAT I'LL BE HIS RESURRECTION
TRIES TO BLOW THE DUST OF HIS MIC AND MAKE A NEW RECORD
BUT NOW HE'S FUCKED THE GAME UP CAUSE ONE OF THE WAYS I CAME UP
WAS THROUGH THAT PUBLICATION THE SAME ONE THAT MADE ME FAMOUS
NOW THE OWNER OF IT GOT A GRUDGE AGAINST ME FOR NOTHING BUT FUCK IT
THAT MOTHA FUCKER CAN GET IT TOO FUCK EM THEN
BUT I'M SO BUSY BEING PISSED OFF I DON'T STOP TO THINK
THAT WE JUST INHERITED FIFTY'S BEEF WITH MURDER INC
AND HE'S INHERITED MINE WHICH IS FINE AIN'T LIKE EITHER OF US MIND
STILL HAVE SOLDIERS THAT IS ON THE FRONT LINE THATS WILLING TO DIE FOR US
AS SOON AS WE GIVE THE ORDERS 
NEVER TO EXTORT US STRICTLY TO SHOW THEY SUPPORT US
MAYBE SHOUT EM OUT IN A RAP OR UP IN CHORUS 
TO SHOW WE LOVE EM BACK AND TO LET EM KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS 
TO HAVE RUNYON AVENUE SOLDIERS UP IN OUR CORNERS
THEIR LOYALTY TO US IS WORTH MORE THEN ANY AWARD IS
BUT I AIN'T TRYING TO HAVE NONE OF MY PEOPLE HURT OR MURDERED
IT AIN'T WORTH IT I CAN'T THINK OF A PERFECTER WAY TO WORD IT
THEN TO JUST SAY THAT I LOVE Y'ALL TOO MUCH TO SEE THE VERDICT
I'LL WALK AWAY FROM IT ALL BEFORE I'LL LET IT GO ANY FURTHER
NOW DON'T GET IT TWISTED IT'S NOT A PLEA THAT I'M COPING
I'M JUST WILLING TO BE THE BIGGER MAN IF Y'ALL CAN QUIET POPPING OFF
AT THE JAWS WITH THE KNOCKING CAUSE FRANKLY I'M SICK OF TALKING
I'M NOT GONNA LET SOMEONE ELSE'S COFFIN REST ON MY CONSCIOUS
