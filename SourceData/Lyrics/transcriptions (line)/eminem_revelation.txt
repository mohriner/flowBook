I'VE BEEN PRAISED AND LABELED AS CRAZED
MY MOTHER WAS UNABLE TO RAISE ME FULL OF CRAZY RAGE
AN ANGRY TEENAGER NOTHIN CAN CHANGE ME BACK
GANGSTA RAP MADE ME ACT LIKE A MANIAC
I WAS BOOSTIN SO INFLUENCED BY MUSIC I USED IT
AS AN EXCUSE TO DO SHIT OOH I WAS STUPID
NO ONE CAN TELL ME NOTHIN HIP HOP OVERWHELMED ME
TO THE POINT WHERE IT HAD ME IN A WHOLE NOTHER REALM
IT WAS LIKE ISOLATIN MYSELF WAS HEALTHY
IT FELT LIKE WE WAS ON WELFARE BUT WEALTHY
COMPELLED ME TO EXCEL WHEN SCHOOL IT FAILED ME
EXPELLED ME AND WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WOULD TELL ME
I WAS NOTHIN AND I WOULDN'T AMOUNT TO SHIT
I MADE MY FIRST MILLION AND COUNTED IT
NOW LOOK AT A FUCKIN DROPOUT THAT QUITS
STUPID AS SHIT RICH AS FUCK AND PROUD OF IT
THAT'S WHY
