Ashes to eggshells, woodchips to whiskers
Anything we can mess up we can fix up
Sword to plowshare, soiled from beneath the trash
Detroit red into El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
Oildrum to steelpan, prisoner to Gramsci
Rose from the concrete, reverse the flows of the Ponzi schemes
Cripwalk to a conscious beat
Hip-hop is a compost heap
Gangsters to gardeners, rivals into partners
Fanatics to reformers, felons into farmers
