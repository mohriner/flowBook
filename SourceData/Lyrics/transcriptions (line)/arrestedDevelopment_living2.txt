THE MORE GANGSTERS TALK ABOUT DYING AND CRACK COCAINE AND THE VIOLENCE
AND STATION SATURATED WITH IT THE MORE MUSIC BE THRIVING
PEOPLE COMPARE AND CONTRAST, WHATEVER OUR BEAT LACKS
IS MADE UP BY THE MERE FACT WHERE THE ONLY OTHER OPTION
SEEMS LIKE I'M AN ALIEN FORTY PLUS YEARS AND UP
FORTIFIES WITH SOMETHING REAL THAT THE PRESENTS THAT THEY DON'T WANT
SO THE PRESENT DON'T REALLY GET MY PRESENCE AND ALL MY POINTS
NOW I THINK, WORK, PLAY IT AND LIVE IT WITH ACHING JOINTS
THEY ACTING LIKE I AM DUMB, INCLUDING MY ONLY SON
HE'S SIXTEEN ACTING LIKE THAT HE'S GOING TO SIXTY ONE
IT'S LIKE AS IF HEIGHT EQUALS MIGHT IN WISDOM
HE SMIRKS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT I'MA SAY BEFORE I'M DONE
HE JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN, WANNA EAT, WANNA LAY, WANNA SHOP
WANNA LOOK A CERTAIN WAY, WANNA CHILL, YOU WANNA STOP
THAT CRAZINESS, WHO IN THIS GENERATION
IS RAISED UP WITH PURE LAZINESS; AM I FURTHER DATING US
I KNOW IT, THEY WANNA PUT IN THEY HEADPHONES, ESCAPE IN A WORLD
THEY WANT TO GET UP ON THEIR CELLPHONES AND RELATE WITH LITTLE GIRLS
I CAN DIG IT TO ABOUT FIVE FEET ELEVEN INCHES
BUT THE LAST INCH IS WHERE MY DIGGING STOPS, I DON'T DO DITCHES
I WON'T PUT YOU TO DEATH, I BROUGHT YOU LIFE
THROUGH MY SPERM AND MY MUSIC, YEAH, I BROUGHT IT TWICE
