I'm from the year-round shootouts to summertime cookout
The wintertime grind with the shorties on the lookout
A chosen few know the rule, the rest threw the book out
The law stay on crews, thirsty with they hook out
That old-school bang out Money that pulled the thang out
They bit him and hit him with a few, he just came out
With the sharks that travel all parts within the same route
Narrow walls closin in, cutthroat to exit at the opening
Wrong place, you wasn't where you were supposed to been
You back around the end, heavy wasteline again
With them same suspect cats that waste time again
Ya'll need to wake the fuck up, and peep the monument in your face
Cuz ain't no time to waste not a minute
I seen my cousin, Man said "Peace, yo where you been at?"
He said the final frontier riq, I'm up in that
And it's the time to watch the place your foe and where your friend at
Cuz where I rotate ain't nothin to grin at, I been at
The fork in the crossroads, the outer limit
See you can stand tall or crawl and act timid
The Black Thought with the Black Star, infinite
