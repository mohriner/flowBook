your body like a flick it got surprisin twists 
i write the script the main character your thighs and hips 
award for best supportin role go to your eyes and lip 
the way you move your body got em stiff like a hieroglyph 
i watched you dance across the floor to the title track 
you bout to get me off the wall like you michael jack 
i make describing your beauty my sacred duty 
i will write a song write a book write a play make a movie
