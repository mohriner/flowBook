Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop
Not r and b because to me that's not my style and
The r double o quotes ain't for radio, 
but major sold them that the zip won't change the dial
I remember one morning at the Soul Shack, coolin
In the outback, on the songwriting ship
Blitz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff
On the cloud I be relaxin from the last night and shit
In studio today but hey BROther question
Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone
And tell him to get ready Question, what ya doin
But a chicken wing, so I met him in the West
Where we had to lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes
Bassey broke down on the other side of town
Yo you know what it's about, The Roots is out To the subway
