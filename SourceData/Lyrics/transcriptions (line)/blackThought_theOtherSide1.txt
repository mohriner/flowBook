Yo we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it's counterfeit 
Evrybody catching hay fever like sinuses 
Step in my arena let me show y'all who the highness is 
You might say I could be doing something positive 
Humble head down low and broke like promises 
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is 
Not enough paper to be paying folks complements 
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain't no truth in a dare without the consequence 
Listen if it not for these hood inventions 
I'd be just another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence 
even if I'm going to hell I'm gonna make an entrance Yeah
let em know I'm getting cheese like omlets is 
But I'm the toast of the town like Thomas is
