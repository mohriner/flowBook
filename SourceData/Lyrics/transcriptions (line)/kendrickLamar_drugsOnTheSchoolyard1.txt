i'm whatever the streets made the saint the renegade 
the chain on the timid slaves the dead on the corner 
the van of the coroner the ambulance first aid 
the criminals crime wave the dominant point guard 
the drugs on the schoolyard the kid on the go cart 
the bucket that won't start the ruckus that won't stop 
the city that hate cops the niggas that's fed up 
shoot and shake cops the obstacle war block 
the feeling of victory the friend the enemy 
the positive energy the negative force that forces 
you to sip hennessy 
and sin like a sinner that exempts all sympathy 
the churches that god built the verses that i killed 
the curse that the devil gave the start of the end of days 
the happy and the afraid they dap me and give me praise 
but we're nothing alike see i am life motherfucker
