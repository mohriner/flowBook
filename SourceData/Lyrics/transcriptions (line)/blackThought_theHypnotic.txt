I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed in to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan tourough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
With a fat flick to cool out Was stressed 
cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out And go the old school route
But all of that cease when at peace, checkin the jewel out
My brother was charged light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me With a massage to anoint
Lubricatin my maridian points 
that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on Tariq Agenda how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recommend her
But as time float on we grew more mature and further apart
When I began to do tours we lost contact
And slowly parted reminiscing of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it  the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated  spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuz the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic
