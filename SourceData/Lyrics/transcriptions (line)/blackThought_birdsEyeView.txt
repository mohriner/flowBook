It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kuberick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two berrick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a hom- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple oh gees got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Now, I'm on your block with Somali pirates
