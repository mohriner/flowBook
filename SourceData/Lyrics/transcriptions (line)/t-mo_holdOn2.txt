I can't escape the bullshit Where ever I go shit 
Always into something cause I wanna be rich 
Pulling cards in my blood it seems I'm mean cause of my look 
I might blast off on ya ass and write another book 
It took too many times in the cage 
Now I'm on the front page looking at myself I'm on the run
Never to be seen by the eyes 
A fugitive Plus I got a life to live State by state 
Is this just a dream? Sometimes it seems 
like it just a figure standing in the mirror from the back 
That's why I'm swinging my axe 
Everytime so I won't miss I can be hit 
Cause I'm touchable That's my state of mind 
Cause I know one day you gotta go in a life of crime 
Either the pen or a one way ticket 
So I'm asking "what will it be"? "Where do I solve"? 
Nobody knows but me see 
When I was a youth used to think I was bulletproof
Never thought I could be hit Ready to stand my turf
Niggaz can't understand how it work What's the plan?
We killing our own people for this bullshit Scared straight
wanna escape theres one way outta this crooked county with a bounty 
Coming to get me Then i'd be on the run
Hoping to find a better day without loaded guns in my face 
I'm not the criminal Fuck your probation 
What's my occupation? Selling my dubbs on the street 
Cause I gotta eat Hold on
