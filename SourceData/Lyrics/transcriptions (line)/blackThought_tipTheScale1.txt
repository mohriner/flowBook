I'm always early I never take off 
cause I got a job Rob Peter to pay Paul 
Now I realize it's the winner that takes all 
Do what I gotta do because I can't take loss
Picture me living life as if I'm some animal 
That consumes its own dreams like I'm a cannibal 
I won't accept failure unless it's mechanical 
But still the alcohol mixed with the botanical 
I guess I be referred to the owners manual full of loners 
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with eighth grade diplomas 
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus 
Look let he without sin live without sin Until then
I'll be doing dirty jobs like swamp men 
Counting the faces of those that might have been
It's like living that life but I won't live that life again
