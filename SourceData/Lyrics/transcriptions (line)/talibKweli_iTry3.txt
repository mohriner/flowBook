yo the things im seein on the news is insane 
a stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front the train 
a mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself 
two years old eatin ketchup and mustard cryin for help 
tryin to bring your struggle to life the label want a song about a bubbly life 
i have trouble tryin to write some shit to bang in the club through the night 
when people suffer tonight lord knows i try
