I let you 
stay in my crib now you know 
where I live When you was hungry 
fed you a hot meal look at the 
hand you deal Me crudball
business nigga giving inches so here take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbits feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the
best teacher until we get our own plate 
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours 
Process smuh muh moking like Jerry 
Meanwhile fairies up the street sprinkling pixie 
dust over greenery Never to attain another 
level of con science only to test the 
potency Why laying here they scheme 
over one another mouth to feed Deceased with a 
decision to make let words shake your 
destiny But one miss will take it all the way 
just as quick as you can say I wish I never
did what I did now face this bid It was the 
company you kept the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have
geeking like a rat jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club
showing pink for ten 
Got you niggas where they want you again 
Floating face down in the mainstream
