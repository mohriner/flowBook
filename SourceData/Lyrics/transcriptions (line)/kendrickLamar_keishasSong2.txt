and lord knows she's beautiful lord knows the usuals 
leaving a body sore her anatomy is god's temple 
and it's quite simple 
her castle is bout to be destroyed she's always paranoid 
watching the law inside the streets undercovers the dummies that look like decoys 
remember sergeant let her slide 
said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise 
to no surprise she took the ultimatum round the alleyway 
and gave him a warm welcome that filled him 
right below the navel though he was wired up 
like a pair of jumping cables his eyes was closed shut 
prior charges he had waived em it was a block away from lueders park 
i seen a squad car parked and in her heart she hate it there 
but in her mind she made it where nothing really matters 
so she hit the back seat cause rosa parks never factor 
when she topping off police
