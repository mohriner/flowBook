I'm not the table you can come and
lay your cup down on now
Iâ€™m not the shoulder for a bag,
don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when
you're lookin for a short cut
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on,
i ain't nobody's crutch
I ain't the money man, with your
money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son,
you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up,
all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for em,
if you checkin' in Motha fucka check this out
