Yeah it's still me one of your biggest fan 
I get off work right back to work again 
I probly need to go ahead and have my head exam 
Look how they got me on the Deaf Jam payment plan
Well I'm in the world of entertainment and
Tryna keep a singing man sane for the paying fans 
If I don't make it through the night slight change of plans 
Harp strings angel wings and praying hands 
Lord forgive me for my shortcomings 
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons 
All I'm tryna do is live life to the fullest 
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets 
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image 
And why is living life such a fight to the finish 
For this high percentage when the sky's the limit 
A second is a minute evry hour's infinite
