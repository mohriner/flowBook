I was cold hearted and young a dumb kid with a gun 
Cuz fun days don't last the last nigga to laugh
So rap fell on my tongue numb feelings remain 
And pain comes and it goes 
But my wounds shows the room where my pops beat my moms 
Moms screamin' for help myself hot as a sun 
Cold hearted and young a dumb kid with a gun 
That I got from my pops top drawer when he left my momma twice in a week 
My momma lifeless and weak spendin' her nights in the sheets 
With seed killer number Seed killer number Seed killer number 
Got heat from the newborns scorned brother 
Blu black hearted and young 
Raps fell off his tongue 
Numb feelings remain The pain comes and it goes 
But my wounds show the tomb that now shelters my boy 
My boy needed my help myself not in the game 
The game heartless and young Dumb niggas with guns 
cause fun days don't last 
The last nigga that blast got shots all in his back 
Wrath fell on his soul but in my soul he remains 
Pain comes and it goes 
But my wounds show the moon shining off of his blood 
His blood ran through his moms His moms ran outside 
Five niggas with guns Seed killer number Seed killer number Seed killer number 
Pulled the heat and he was through Threw dirt on his casket 
his mom will remask it 
Still couldn't hide tears years pass her son 
Numb feelings remain Pain comes and it goes 
But my wounds show the groom that still married my mom 
My mom still had a son Dumb kid with a gun 
that I got from my pops 
Top drawer when he left My momma fightin' for years
My momma fightin' her tears 
Now she gotta explain the game of her life to her son
But the sun still shines 
Nine children and a newborn scorn brother 
two Blu life isn't young 
Dumb kid with a tongue that I got from Hip Hop 
But she left me for you so I'mma give her to you 
Cold hearted and young
