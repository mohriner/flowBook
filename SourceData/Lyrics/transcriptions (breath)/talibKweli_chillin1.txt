e is chillin 
kwe is chillin 
whip in the house brooklyn in the building 
blood on the dance floor sweat on the ceiling when you get that feeling that 
gun concealing is a hobby 
nobody stealing shows like kweli working on a new project while you chillin in the lobby keep it through the way real 
guns dont kill 
people kill people but the sun dont chill 
but still i stand cooler than a minnesota winter nigga hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners 
plus all the sinners got dreams they running after working a nine to five now is like you hustling backwards 
thats why all these young girls in love with the rappers 
basketball players and up and coming actors 
swimming with the sharks and flirting with disaster when the things you own start owning you they your master
