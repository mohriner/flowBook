It's like rags on an automatic nigga this a banger
And I always keep one up in the chamber 
May day, may day it's my pay day and you in danger 
I broke it down to a baby in a manger 
I won't age in the presence of a stranger 
With twenty eight a savage foe with no remainder 
sixteen twenty eighths 
for the crew 
You ain't balling out for me But I'm a bring that work to you 
Water whippin 
I leave your daughter drippin' 
I'm speaking up cash like a fucking politician 
I'm politicking with niggas that be the richest They keep 
kicking to me just go get it 
I'm so with it 
From snap backs to a fitted true religion In denim that skrill I keep it all up in em 
I'm dipping like a pimp with hoes lost they will shrink 
Two words to the world from me 
get rich biatch
