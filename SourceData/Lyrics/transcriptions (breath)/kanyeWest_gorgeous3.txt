I need more drinks and less lights 
And that American Apparel girl in just tights 
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
It's been a while since I watched the tube 
Cause like a Crip said 
I got way too many blues for any more bad news 
I was looking at my resume 
feeling real fresh today They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday And what's a black Beatle anyway 
a fucking roach 
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach 
My guy said I need a diffrent approach 
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore try diffrent jokes 
Tell em hug and kiss my ass
ex and oh 
Kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it Play strings for the dramatic
ending of that wack shit 
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever Who has it 
You blowin' up that's good fantastic That y'all 
it's like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all 
Cause the same people that tried to blackball me Forgot about two things my black balls
