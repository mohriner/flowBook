Once upon a time not long ago 
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow 
When laws were stern and justice stood 
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good 
There lived a lil' boy who was misled 
By another lil' boy and this is what he said: 
Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash 
They did the job, 
money came with ease 
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease 
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha 
Tried to rob a man who was a D T undercover 
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic He said Keep still, boy, no need for static 
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap 
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped 
The kid pulled out a gun, he said Why did ya hit me? 
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney 
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure 
I'll do years if I pull this trigga 
So he cold dashed and ran around the block Cop radios it to another lady cop 
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista 
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her 
Looked around good and from expectations he decided he'd head for the subway stations But 
she was coming and he made a left 
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath 
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him 
Then he made his move to an abandoned building 
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor 
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? 
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap 
He said I need bullets, hurry up, run! 
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun 
He went outside but there was cops all over Then he dipped into a car, 
a stolen Nova 
Raced up the block doing eighty three 
Crashed to a tree near university 
Escaped alive though the car was battered 
Rat a tat tatted and all the cops scattered 
Ran out of bullets and still had static 
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic 
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead He told the cops 
back off or honey here's dead 
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong So he let the lady go and he starts to run on 
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded and 
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded 
He dropped the gun, 
so went the glory 
And this is the way I have to end this story 
He was only seventeen, in a mad man's dream 
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream 
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh 
Just another case about the wrong path 
Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast
