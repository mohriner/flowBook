They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, 
and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols And they want to get one, 
'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, 
of course the shit's affecting ourselves You ignoramus 
but music is reflection of self We just explain it, 
and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it, 
how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we 
sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives 'Til they sit and they cry at night, 
wishing they die 'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe We're nothing to you, 
but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes That's why we 
seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 
'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs And we can
