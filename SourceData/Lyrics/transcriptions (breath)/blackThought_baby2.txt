Your old man don't like to jitterbug 
said this old dirty music 
Hip hop just so ridiculous 
them stories too confusing 
Nowadays he ain't loving you like he was 
And you ain't there just for using 
Could have sworn that was him with another girl 
And they wasn't out just for cruising 
Can't get no satisfaction 
He out late nights 
probly smashing 
Leaving a trail like trolley tracks 
Or the train on the ground downtown Manhattan 
Evrybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him 
The condoms you found and asked him 
was all this just for practice 
He didn't reuhlize what he had 
Now your heart got fractured girl
