in the concrete jungle wild animal 
stomach growling like lions its understandable 
rappers will run right up on you and try to battle you 
quicker than a cheetah run up on a caribou 
what up tuna the blacksmith is back with the back flip flow and got the survival tactics we crack it 
open like the seal on a package came with a message 
we must retain the freshness 
you lame and you plain depressing 
is this what the game is left with 
on homie name the weapons 
soon as mister international step in 
you rapping irresponsible irrational death wish 
ready i got enough lyrics i be stocking up 
in all suspense boy you better lock it up 
is it live or what 
we came to rock it now 
treat it like its out of pocket
