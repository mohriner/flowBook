One for the money yes uhh two for the show 
A couple of years ago on headland and delowe
Was the start 
of somethin good 
Where me and my nigga rodes the marta 
through the hood 
Just tryin ta find that hookup 
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin off instrumental 
had my pencil 
and plus my paper 
We caught the eighty six lithonia headed to decatur writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot 
known that we could rock 
doin the hole in the wall clubs this shit here must stop 
Like freeze we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's and that's a no no
