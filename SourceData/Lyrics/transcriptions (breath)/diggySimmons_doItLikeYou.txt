It seems like 
for a while I've know ya 
Nostalgic moments 
feels like magic don't it
Girl you killin em
my condolence 
That's how you on it? 
Yea that's how you on it
And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic tryna cut straight to the chase 
Wanna be there when you wake 
With no make up on your face 
Not even gloss, before you brush 
Love your dimples when you blush 
It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine 
What's yo sign? 
I'm an Aries, I'm a nineties baby clearly I'll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary
Hold up, hold up, hold up
I just wanna know ya 
I heard em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder 
Well girl my vision's bad so Imma need you to come closer
Closer,
now you right here where you posed to.
