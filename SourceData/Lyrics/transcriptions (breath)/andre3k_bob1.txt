In slum national underground thunder pounds when I stomp the ground 
Like a million elephants with silverback orangutans You can't stop a train
Who want some Don't come unprepared I'll be there but when I leave there
better be a household name 
weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop top soakin wet
In a silk suit tryin' not to sweat 
Hits somersaults without the net 
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
One Nine Nine Nine ano domini 
anything goes be whatchu wanna be 
Long as you know consequences are given for livin the fence is 
too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig I might just touch hell
hot 
Get a life now they gon' sell 
Then I might catch you a spell 
look at what came in the mail 
A scale and some Arm and hammer 
so grow grid and some baby mama 
Black cadillac and a pack of pampers 
Stack of question 
with no answers 
Cure for cancer 
cure for AIDS 
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days 
Get back home 
things are wrong 
well not really it was bad all along before you left adds up to a ball of power 
Thoughts at a thousands miles per hour 
hello ghetto let your brain breathe 
believe there's always mo'
