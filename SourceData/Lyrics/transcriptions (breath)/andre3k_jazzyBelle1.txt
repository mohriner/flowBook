Oh yes I love her like egyptian want a description my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin crickets and crows bitches and hoes to queen thangs
over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs like kilroy
chill boi because them folks might think you soft talkin like that man
fuck them niggaz I'm goin off and comin right back like boomerangs when you throw em 
With these old ghetto poems 
bankhead is better for em
When they can let they throw em 
down from hitchikin and bitin niggaz until the temple they call the body 
now everybody got it 
Had it 
talked about it amongst they friends 
comin around my crew lookin jazzy wanna pretend 
like you Ms. goodie 
Four Shoes even Bo knew 
that you got poked 
like acupuncture patients while our nation is a boat Straight sinkin 
I hate thinkin that these the future mommas of our chillin 
they fuckin a different nigga every time they get the feelin to 
I'm willin to go the extra kilo 
meter just to see my senorita get her pillow 
on the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play but now it's real jazzy Belle
