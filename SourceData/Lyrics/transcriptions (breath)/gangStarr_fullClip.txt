Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again 
Fatten my plate again,
y'all cats know we always play to win 
G A N G 
to the Starr son 
Haters took this shit too far son 
So that's all for you, I'm wiping out your whole team 
I'll 
splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes 
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell 
The more lies you sell, and by surprise you fell Into my death trap, 
right into my clutches 
Stupid, you know the God must bless every single mic he touches I've suffered, 
just so I could return harder 
Wanna be the shit starter, 
fuck around, make you a martyr 
I make ya famous, 
turn around and make ya nameless Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is 
Save it and hold that, 
you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one
