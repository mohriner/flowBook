you running back to the kid like this was home base 
or a marathon i let you set your own pace 
your own space in the beautiful struggle now baby tell me what it gon take to prove that i love you 
when im gone you be missing me too 
it let me know that my prayers is the music god be listening to 
dont get it confused 
aint trying get religious with you 
i never thought i feel like this its like a miracle you 
stole my heart like a crook in love 
crossing the bridge to the brooklyn love when i look above its clear skies thats surrounding my earth 
your love is drugs and im down to serve lets deal with it yo 
we go to the spot and you still get it low
i get excited fast and still love to hit it slow till the walls come tumbling down like jericho 
and you hear the sound is stereo here we go
