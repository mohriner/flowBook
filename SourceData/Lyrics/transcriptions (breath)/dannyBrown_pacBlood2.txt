What's in the portfolio Sicker than polio 
Shit so personal my mom can't listen to Oh so original 
nigga's extra crispy
Bars so Bukowski 
Soda Popinski 
Little Macs could never be number one your time's done Bomb filling smelling like napalm your day's gone 
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook 
Spitting like Kipling 
with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men women and children Memoir's sacred 
hid in the basement 
Await my next piece at a formal engagement 
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound 
Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns 
Tears to Mona Lisa 
Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner wanna shoot shit 
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked 
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup 
Make Sarah Palin deep throat til she hiccup 
Had T D Jakes round this bitch doing stickups
Rhymes so real thought I wrote it in Pac blood 
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs
