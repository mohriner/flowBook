yo 
live at your stereo your hero get dinero though 
i have the name em name a country after like amerigo vespucci we authentic like the gucci with the serial number these rappers fruity like the pebbles in your cereal wonder why 
some will die by the code of the samurai 
if this is nine eleven they the fireman that ran inside 
dreams put on hold like 
operators standin by 
camouflage like a mirage dodgin the cameras eye 
kweli and ak make your chick fantasize with spanish fly 
we ever take the stand you know we plan to lie 
what kind of man am i 
im way off if you think ill take a day off this aint ferris bueller 
im not camera fry 
kick the sand in your eye ground your ass if you plan to fly burnin through your skin like a can of lye 
and rockin with dilla since stand to the side my fists up like a panther with pride 
fans will decide who the truth when it come to this rap shit

classic in the year of the blacksmith 
boston to new york city
