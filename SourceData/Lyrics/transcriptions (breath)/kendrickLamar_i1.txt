they wanna say it's a war outside 
bomb in the street 
gun in the hood mob of police 
rock on the corner with a line for the fiend and a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh 
these days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation 
i duck these cold faces post up fi fie fo fum basis 
dreams of reality's peace 
blow steam in the face of the beast 
sky could fall down wind could cry now look at me motherfucker i smile i love myself uh
