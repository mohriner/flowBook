I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I
I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang 
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it I'm confessing one more lesson from the South we in the house tonight 
Now hootie who wants to oppose 
suppose
We rolls through headland and delowe where me and my niggas would pass the flow and got down
for ours like hind catchers 
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at 
The southern slang 
finger waves and mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang so go ahead and 
diss it 
while real hop hippers listen 
started by afrika bambaata so 
you and your partner gather your thoughts
