mama says she love it when i'm color coordinated so i pull up in a maroon coupe 
with maroon laces in my supers i maneuver like macgyver when it's time to ride 
say she always feeling blue 
when he telling white lies 
rain on her window pain 
all she see is grey skies 
told her hit this purple 
maybe this will ease your mind i'm rocking purple label 
check out my shirt design 
perfect with her purple kisses slack track number eight 
from the dream maybe this is something you ain't neva see 
put you in a real world 
take you out that green screen 
sippin on pink panties 
in the stretched limousine they takin off pink panties 
when we hit the room please 
don't confuse me for no murderer like norman bates but i'm about to kill it 
pull out the yellow tape i'm guessing i'm a criminal 
you caught up in my web like a brown recluse 
hey that is a color never seen boo
