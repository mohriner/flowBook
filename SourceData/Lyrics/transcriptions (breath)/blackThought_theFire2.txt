One love one game one desire One flame one bonfire let it burn higher 
I never show signs of fatigue 
or turn tired 
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath 
I made it to the eye of the storm 
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans 
I show em how I got the grind down like a science 
It sounds like a riot on hush 
it's so quiet 
The only thing I hear is my heart
I'm inspired by the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with 
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward 
You can't escape 
the history that you was meant to make 
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take 
You came to celebrate
I came to cerebrate 
I hate losing I refuse to make the same mistake
