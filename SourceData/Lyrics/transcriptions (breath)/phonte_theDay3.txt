Sunday morning plan my day out 
Whole new blueprint brand new layout 
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out 
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight 
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith 
Troubles of the world had me in a cross face 
Chicken wing sickening liver so off base But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase 
and I finely understand my right to choose 
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three legged dog still got three good legs to lose 
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in breathe out let it heal all your exit wounds 
Something inside said that's the move 
and maybe today I'll restart fresh and new
