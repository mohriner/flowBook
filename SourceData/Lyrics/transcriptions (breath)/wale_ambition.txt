Well wishes to my opposition 
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol 
I got nothing against them, 
they got fucking potential 
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue 
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be 
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets 
But I'm limitless mentally, 
I'm lyrically Z M T 
Lebron shit, 
I was in that six after twenty three 
And family is everything, 
and money is less important 
Long as your mama love you, 
don't ever love a woman 
I got a lot of bitches, 
they got a lot of feelings But I got that green on my eyes And that ain't no Donnie Simpson 
I retire you niggas: 
fuck you and your position! 
They place holding so slippery niggas can't even kick it 
Y'all rambling, talking shit to these bitches You know you real you don't say it You know you real, we gon feel it
