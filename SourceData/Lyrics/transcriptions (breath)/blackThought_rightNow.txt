Right now, somebody is sitting in the darkness Trying to figure out how to put some heat in they apartment But 
they got a little mattress, 
little carpet
And they appreciate it cause some people on a park bench
You see them when you rushing to get to the office
Wife fly by when she coming home from the market
Right now somebody's coming out the pocket Trying to dump that rock, 
they run around the block with
Same time the cops is raising their Glocks With aim 
to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody is struggling to stop this man
Who's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, the child taking his first breath The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet Yo, 
I wonder if he understand what it's worth yet Like 
time spent, while we're on the earth yea
The answer to the question we all seek
Can be found, it depends on how free y'all think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week That would kill 
for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinity, the next say forever Right now everybody gotta 
get it together, man
