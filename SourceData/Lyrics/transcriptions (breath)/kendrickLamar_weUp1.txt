visualize everything i needed and dream 
penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme 
guns in your video get you locked in a bing me i kill a nigga quick no worries my record clean 
murder one become manslaughter soon as they brought up 
charity work parking tickets and no charges 
fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick should a been a bitch in pajamas 
i made my first million fucking dollars 
bought a bible oh yeah god got me 
made my second million dollars bought a chopper and binocular i'm scared this shit don't happen to everybody 
i'm on instagram looking at your favorite singer 
debating on should i fuck or jump on her single 
twenty thou she got a hell of a ad lib
