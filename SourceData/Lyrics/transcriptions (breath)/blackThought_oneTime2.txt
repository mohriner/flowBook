Not a thing I fear besides fear itself 
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf 
Cross around my neck
I've been taught by stealth 
Capture this moment in time it's a smash and grab 
And where my party people y'all finna have a blast 
You say good bye I say hello 
first and last
Hello Hello Now all of y'all elevate your glass 
To an example of what
time will do to you When 
those nameless things just keep on eluding you When 
shit is new to you and 
lies is true to you 
Words of suspects usual 
coming though to you Man 
I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time 
Then I went missing 
looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low 
 left the ladder unclimbed Time after time verse blank the line unrhymed
