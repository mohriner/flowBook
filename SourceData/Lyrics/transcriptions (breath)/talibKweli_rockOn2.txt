the way i spit is ghetto 
like when niggas pray over beef like khalil and get the metal til the shit is settled 
i pull strings like geppetto did pinocchio 
yall niggas sing to po po like 
k c and jo jo or sisqo and nokio 
le le and coco yall 
sisters with voices yall 
lyrics are pointless 
my lyrics anoint like oils and ointments 
i had a date with death but i missed my appointment 
yall walkin through the valley while i run through it 
every party we come through makin the gun music 
practice the art of war dont make me sun tzu it i put them knots in yo head til you cant undo it 
you cant unscrew it 
ladies wanna take it off 
all they want is piece of mind so i break em off 
i grab the game by the balls until i made it cough 
and made these bitch ass niggas take they make up off
