Yo hello everybody do I need introduct
I be the mic mercenary very unclear
To your ear the exquisite pattern that you hear It's known to be Black Butta Baby
Crazy cardiac my attack on any fat rhythm That I capture kid I snatch the mic from tykes While I proceed 
and continue 
to tend to
Business, cause this is, how I do
I'm insane, and go against the grain like freight
Never on no nigga dick, cause I'm just too hip
Plus I rest where niggas pack and never act Other than ill, 
shit is real in phi double
So if you want trouble let's stomp 
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away
