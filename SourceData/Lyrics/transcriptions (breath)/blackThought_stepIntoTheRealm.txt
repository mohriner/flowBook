I'm from the valley of the heavy-heads 
Watch the ghetto pre-medical Undergrads and steady red faces of stone
Eyes are crevices, 
life like a double negative
Philly criminal, I rhyme my 
dirt, Tariq already did Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thought-less, 
trespass and enter Thought's fortress
Limitless entrance, 
paid 
to the order of the Cypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless
Defenseless, 
niggas never moving me inches
The beat Fifth, 
invisible in the trenches
Aficianado, 
awesome hip hop drug problem
Fuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham
Poltergeist, slit or choke the mic 
til it scream to me Stop that, 
cash we conveniently got that
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, 
the nine eight, 
El Dorado Cadillac Jacks
