Yo it's too much strain for nominal gain I'm going through things 
headaches abdominal pain 
Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine 
Check the blue flame
lighter running out of butane What's up with 
my destructive urge that's unproductive
Choices I'm stuck with now starting to fuck with 
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop
burning the candle at both ends 
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge 
hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in 
The darker the covenant
slash train wreck for you to rubber neck 
You ain't felt the true pain yet
so you be loving that 
Hit me up at black dot 
gov like the government
Banana Republican 
alien intelligence 
Kill switch real pissed thinking of some ill shit 
The stone the builder refused
he need to build with 
Got immunized for both flus I'm still sick 
Via satellite radio the realness
