Yo 
I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes 
I gotta be out 
at the height of the night
And that's when 
she flip and get on some ol Another lonely night Seem like 
I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper Daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, 
you dig me
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player 
and he think I'm pretty Psych, 
I'm playing boo
You know it's just wit you I'm staying boo
And when cats be popping game
I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world
I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leaving you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt
