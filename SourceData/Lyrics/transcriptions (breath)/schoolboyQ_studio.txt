You need a real nigga, shorty so come in, 
throw that pussy, shorty See I think you and me can make it, 
this little verse to get you naked 
See, your heart ain't meant for breaking, 
Cupid's never been mistaken See, I been caught up in the moment, 
shit, my type ain't quite her type 
But now this gangsta nigga on it, 
she can twist my weed and hit the yac 
I can hit your type without the hat, 
put that pussy on the map 
I see qualities in a bad girl, 
I know that ass you got Come with attitude and your swag, girl, 
you ain't wrong, girl 
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl 
Cause you girl, 
cause you girl, girl, 
cause you girl, girl
