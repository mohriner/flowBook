Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline
well burn motherfucka burn american Dream 
Don't everybody like the taste of apple Pie 
We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why 
I hear that mother nature's now on birth control 
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold 
The highway up to heaven got a crook on the toll 
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go 
nowhere to go 
All of my heroes did dope 
every nigga round me playin' married
Or payin child support
I can't cope 
never made no sense to me one day I hope it will And that's that 
sport sport
Pray I live to see the day when seven's happily married With kids 
woe woe 
The world is movin fast and I'm losin my balance No time to dig 
low low 
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up Ya wit me say shit 
sho sho 
Now let me ask ya'll this
