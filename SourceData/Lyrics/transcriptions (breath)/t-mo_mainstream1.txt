Revolutionary
scary
Thought provoking spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see 
Visions from me 
At twenty three 
making it free 
in my community One day
is what I live for 
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with 
Adapt and overcome
oh hum hum 
go get my gun load up for fun 
and put down with the frown 
What goes round comes round from M. L. K.
to Cascade 
I know its through them plenty figures cocaine dealers walk the wrong side 
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time 
then selling dimes now its quarter keys stacking gees 
In the South Indies my nigga them folks riding bicycles among 
vehicles off in the hood 
Knowing each and every nigga selling 
but can you blame the fact the only way a brother can survive the game 
the block hard to get by the dope dealing 
fatal killings And fed time
so writing rhymes 
It ain't just the police 
We kill each other just lost another brother fast living will get you took 
Thinking it can't 
happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream 
Floating face down in the mainstream
