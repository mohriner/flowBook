When at first I caught ya creepin
Wasn't even sleepin She hit the speaker and bleeped him, 
peeped him
My nigga baseball was ready to beat him, 
leak him
I told my nigga Chill that they be cheatin 
Used to spend and give you money 
We used to make love and let me lick and dip in ya honey, 
it's funny
Because before you it was the bunny, 
she want me
Told me pull it out and don't even come in
