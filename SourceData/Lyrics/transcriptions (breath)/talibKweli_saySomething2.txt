we not fallin for your trick cause your image is like a gimmick 
forget it every rhyme is bitten you like a mimic 
im talkin to the lord and im askin him for forgiveness just for kickin niggas out the club like michael richards 
yeah i admit it im guilty the way i spit it is filthy i keep it gritty so they get it they feel me the flow 
is known for touchin the soul of street hustlers 
i speak in the language they know i keep customers 
the writin therapeutic its due to the pain and sufferin while these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance 
im givin you a contact high my name buzzin and i came in the game with nothin 
stop frontin nigga talk shit now
