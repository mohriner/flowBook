Straight off the fuckin' streets of C P T 
King of the beats you ride to em in your Fleet
or Coupe DeVille rollin' on dubs
How you feelin' whoopty whoop nigga whut? 
Dre and Snoop chronicled out in the lack 
with Doc in the back, sippin' on yak 
Clip in the strap, dippin' through hoods
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood! 
South Central out to the Westside 
It's California Love,
this California bud got a nigga gang of pub 
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club 
with my jeans on,
and my team strong
Get my drink on, 
and my smoke on 
Then go home with, 
something to poke on 
Loc it's on for the two triple oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode
