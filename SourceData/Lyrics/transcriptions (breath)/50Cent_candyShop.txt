You could have it your way,
how do you want it? 
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it? Temperature rising, ok, 
let's go to the next level 
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle 
I break it down for you now, baby it's simple 
If you be a nympho, 
I be a nympho 
In the hotel or in the back of the rental On the beach or in the park, 
it's whatever you into Got the magic stick, 
I'm the love doctor 
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working baby, 
no problem 
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider 
I'm a seasoned vet, when it come to this shit 
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick 
I'm trying to explain baby, the best way I can 
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hand
