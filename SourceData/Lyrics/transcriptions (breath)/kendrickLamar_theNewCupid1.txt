as i 
play out the commodores 
my faith destroyed 
my heart don't work 
i'm unemployed 
the feeling is void 
don't know what i need 
some pussy some paper some counseling maybe some henny some weed 
i'm looking for you 
i'm checking for her 
i'm parking lot pimpin' i'm honking at women i'm all on the curb 
skirt skirt skirt 
pump my brake pump my brake 
mini 
skirt skirt skirt 
don't walk away 
walk away i'm 
fishing for compliments 
this is a fairy tale i know you very well fuck all your promises 
i know what time it is 
i'm just a realist 
i am the realest 
reality is fatality cursed on the future for family wife and some kids 
i'm looking for you 
i'm checking for her 
i'm parking lot pimpin' i'm honking at women i'm all on the curb 
skirt skirt skirt 
pump your brake 
pump your brake 
mini 
skirt skirt skirt 
don't walk away 
walk away
