and so he said 
why you gotta be so kind hearted 
why you couldn't be a con artist 
why you couldn't why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil devious the moment that we first started 
why you never ask for nothing just a lil time 
why you let me use yours cus i don't got mine 
why you always lift me up when i'm completely giving up or when niggas holla what's up you give a dry response 
why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it 
why you always buy me something when you going shopping 
why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me want my company rather than going club hopping 
why you treating my momma like she your momma too 
why you making promises that you'll forever do 
whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you 
sometimes
