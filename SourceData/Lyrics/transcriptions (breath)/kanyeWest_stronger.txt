Let's get lost tonight 
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight 
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight 
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right? 
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior 
Damn, they don't make em like this anymore 
I ask, cause I'm not sure Do anybody make real shit anymore? 
Bow in the presence of greatness 
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us 
You should be honored by my lateness 
That I would even show up to this fake shit 
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit 
Specially in my Pastel, on my Bape shit 
Act like you can't tell who made this New Gospel homie, take six, 
and take this, 
haters
