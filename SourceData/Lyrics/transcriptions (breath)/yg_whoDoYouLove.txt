I'm that nigga with the plugs 
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs 
I'm the nigga on the back street 
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes 
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga 
My Bank of America account got six figures 
I'm that nigga on the block 
Police pull up, 
I'm tryna stash the Glock 
You that nigga on the low low 
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the poe pose 
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's 
Niggas can't afford these 
The Panamera shittin' on the nine eleven 
I call my homies, not nine eleven 
I'm the nigga with the juice But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q
