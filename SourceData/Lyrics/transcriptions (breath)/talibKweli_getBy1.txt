we sell 
crack to our own out the back of our homes we smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn we go through episodes too 
like attack of the clones work til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
we commute to computers spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors 
we survivalists turned to consumers 
just to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
ask him why some people got to live in a trailer cuz like a sailor i paint a picture with the pen like norman mailer mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself 
with no help i think about her struggle and i find the strength in myself 
these words 
melt in my mouth they hot like the jail cell in the south 
before my nigga core bailed me out 
to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
just to get by 
we do or die like bed sty see the red sky out the window of the red eye let the lead fly some g rap shit living to let die
