Clap something but whatever you clap 
Clap to the record spinning while I'm taking you back 
To the top paper era baby dig on that 
Picture the pool room where the money getters was at
And street people with the feathers in the cap of their Borsalino 
Pulling paper in as if it's a small casino 
I was a young boy sweeping the floors And runnin to stores
But all those old heads would talk to me though
About the way to clutch the eagle on a buck and tuck
And if I'm down how to get back up 
Just survival kid 
and it's a struggle worldwide I'm positive 
Shit the ghetto might as well be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is 
Street walkers you don't see no consciousness 
I'm coming back to where the core of the problem is 
We on the job again 
y'all know what time it is
