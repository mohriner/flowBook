Too democratic 
republic fuck it 
We chicken nugget 
we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket 
Blue collar scholars
who'll take your dollar 
and wipe my ass wit it 
You livin for the lotto never hit it 
I met a critic 
I made her shit her drawers
She said she thought hip hop was only guns and alcohol 
I said Oh hell no 
But yet it's that too 
You can't discrimihate cause you done read a book or two What if I looked at you in a microscope
saw all the dirty organisms living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it
To put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote And a quote for collision the decision 
is 
do you want to live or wanna exist 
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
speeches only reaches those who already know about it This is how we go about it
