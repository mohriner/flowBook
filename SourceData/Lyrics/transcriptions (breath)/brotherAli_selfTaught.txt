Ever since day number one, 
it's just me and where I'm coming from 
Rites of Passage and Shadows on the Sun 
My people, I stand before you, As a man with more true shit Than he knows what to do with 
I give it all to you, long as you can promise me this 
When its time, you will ball up a fist Like this 
Me and Anthony, we fill all the gaps in And are proud of what we make, regardless what happens 
Fuck rappin, I sing off key 
One thing you should never do is dis Ali Cause, 
mother fucker, there ain't nothin rougher Then tryin to climb from the rug you get swept under 
I can run through every one of your blunders
Mistake number one is that your crew don't love ya
Ill take a bullet for the core of the Sayers 
When me and my dogs out tourin the nation 
I spit with an intensity you have to witness 
Look close, my blood on the back of the tickets Its that religious, 
its what I teach my son 
How to read the Quran and how a party is won
