make a joyful noise unto the lord people applaud cause the pen is mightier than the sword 
leavin the floor cause my words cut 
deeper than tissue massage 
i got hooks and lines that sink yall like a fishermans rod 
im on mission for god he blessed me to spit it this hard 
a lot of niggas start shit but they dont finish the job 
im like minister farrakhan 
or them africans who finished a marathon 
the pain in my voice like sarah vaughn 
matter what plane im on i carry on 
even if the dont fit overhead
i carry on 
like flash gordon scar on my face is brad jordan 
passports splash with blood from the battle i last fought in 
i want to cash all in 
or i start breakin like glass jaw i put the blast on em like my last tourin 
or fast forward just to catch what i said 
yo i say some shit like that just to mess with your head 
come on
