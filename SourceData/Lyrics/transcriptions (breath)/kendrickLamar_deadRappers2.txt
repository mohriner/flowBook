yo q these niggas think they cute 
talking louder than the trumpet when i see em 
where the fluke 
your opinion something moving like pew pass by em hog tie em for the revenue 
bullets peer through the bulletproof look what the iron do 
scope now i'm eyeing you 
silencer 
now my iron grew 
i en route 
learn 
of the flow 
first 
to last these rap guys shit on em then throw them to the flies 
bombs like al cater 
ride on my enemies 
homicide 
text like a referee 
give you free shot for any penalty 
drop 
metaphors nouns and verbs plenty similes 
serve like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy 
off k dot the son of tupac 
biggies nephew 
big l said i was special 
now let's do 
lunch 
over these beats 
even punch said i was sweet 
punchlines and kick hot rhymes til i burning my feet ouch
