If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, 
I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, Ill
Check the time as I rhyme, it's nineteen ninety five Whenever I arrive 
the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, 
as I leave behind The video rapper, 
you know, the chart climber
Clapper,
down goes another rapper Onto another matter, 
punch up the data, Blast master
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up K R S, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, 
all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, 
what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned 
as the crosses burned Remember You 
Must 
Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, 
a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer
