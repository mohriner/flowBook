Lyrically versatile 
My rap definition is wild I wrote graffiti as a juvenile 
Restin on deuce trey 
And used to boost gray Kangol's With five 
hundred fifty five 
Soul's from the streets Of the Ill a delphiadic insane
For monetary gain, 
niggas is slain on the train 
it's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, 
where niggas get grazed in the back From stray shots 
Clips with hollow tips, 
for your spine or Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, 
to your mind Niggas ya know my style
I run a motherfucking rap muck
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, 
foot seven, in command of the party And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye 
Of your action cam, 
cause I'm down low 
Artistic exquisite rap pro, 
that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread Thoroughbread for dolo
I bag solo, 
like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin through the corridor, 
of metaphors Lookin over my left 
Shoulder the mic, 
still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit I hit your jaw Dice Raw, get up on the mic, 
my young poor
I be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school 
like eighty-four I never die,
and raps till my lungs collapse Then relax until my knack for tracks 
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain I overcome, 
niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, 
get on the mic and take it over son Dice Raw, 
the motherfuckin Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetrate in this void
