If I can't work to make it I'll rob and take it 
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked 
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow the Matrix
Hey it's me a monster y'all done created 
I've been inaugurated 
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
You can't shake it it ain't no way to swallow the hatred 
Aim fire holla bout a dollar nothin is sacred 
We gone pimp 
the shit out of nature 
Send our troops to get my paper 
Tell em stay away from them skyscrapers 
Ain't long for you get y'all acres
I'mma show em who's the global gangster 
Sentence me to four more years thank you
I'mma make you feel a little bit safer
Because it ain't over See that's how we get your fear to control you
But ain't nobody under more control than the soldier 
And how could you expect a kid to keep his composure 
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure again
