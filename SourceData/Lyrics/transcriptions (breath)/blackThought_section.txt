Y'all know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurer, predator of a competitor
I send emcees where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like 
"nah", I'm nonchalant from afar Then strike 
to cut the fake rap star 
jugular With irregular balance of the cat 
burgalar Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because 
me and the thugs minds are mutual We congruent, 
lay on the corner with the trauma unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed Son you'd get electrocuted 
from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue We go an eye for an eye 
Behead like a samurai 
that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack ability?
Make your words known, amplify the utility
I'm crooked like the I on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, 
the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifth will bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, 
let it rest Reflect, 
then recollect 
on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect 
that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex With my man low to flex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs And the lyrical vandal is next flow So 
my man, my mizza, my man
M-ilitant, what's the master plan? Once again...
