Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position, 
just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, 
she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, 
keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, 
I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, 
I am dead, 
dead to you as can be!
