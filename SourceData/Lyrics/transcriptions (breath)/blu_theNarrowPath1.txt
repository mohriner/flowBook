Picture me sitting in front of eighty eight keys tryn to escape from a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day
Tryna get they gravy straight to floss cause told me homey watch it 
These ladies play dirty games when she get to grinding 
Where niggas pitch as quick as Nolan Ryan Holding iron blowing smoke elope in fire flame spitting
The game is just a way to escape 
And our pain is just a way we can relate to folks crying finding ways I can make a diffrence
But fuck wishing on a star cause the percentage of getting what you envisioned is small 
And the stars barely shine in the city 
so we're blinded by the manmade bright lights making my eyes shifty Feel me out hear me now crying childs of the ghetto Letting go a beautiful sound 
it's kinda falsetto Hello hell
welcome to L A 
where devils that dwell play 
They meddle with metal and letting every shell spray 
Until day dawns 
I make songs for the long road travelers
and lost souls after us 
Spitting lyrics vicious like I'm mad as fuck Packing up my bags hopping back on the narrow path that's planned for us
