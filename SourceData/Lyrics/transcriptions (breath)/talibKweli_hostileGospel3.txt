freedoms a road thats seldom traveled 
watch hell unravel 
right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle 
single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacreds water and not take the hand of every man who make a offer to black kids wishin they white kids 
when they close they eyelids like 
i bet they neighborhood aint like this 
white kids wishin they black kids and wanna talk like rappers its all backwards its identity crisis 
the industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us 
drug suppliers is the health care providers we cakin makin narcotics outta household products 
we aint workin out til we exorcise the demons thats inside us 
plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves enough dope to slang ourselves enough toast to bang ourselves 
its officially nigga season these niggas is bleedin thats why im spittin freedom we had enough of trigger squeezin
