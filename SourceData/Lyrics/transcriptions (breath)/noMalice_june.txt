Just the other day I'm riding on my high horse 
Custom leather seats in the Porsche to die for 
The jewels alone made him sick, 
I am an eyesore 
They couldn't see me like Stevie, 
Mon Cherie Amor 
With three or four baddest of my women friends 
One in the front, two in the back of the latest Benz 
Rims spinning, 
tires Pirelli 
Happy days, 
I'm Fonzerelli 
What you gonna tell me, 
am I not the realest? 
thousand doller bottles, 
just so I can spill it 
In the V I P, standing on the couches Talkin' cash 
cause my money's where my mouth is
