To catch a thief
who stole the soul I prayed to keep 
Insomniac bad dreams got me losing sleep
I'm dead tired my mind playing tricks 
deceit 
A face in the glass unable to admit defeat 
All that I am all that I was is history The past unraveled adding 
insult to this injury I'm
fighting the battle for the soul of the century 
Destiny is evrything that I pretend to be Look
and what I did came back 
to me evenchuhly The music
played on
and told me I was meant to be awake 
It's unresolved like evrything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally Oh 
there I go
from a man to a memory Damn
I wonder if my fam will remember me
