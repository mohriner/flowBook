take a trip with the narcoleptic 
suffered insomnia but this time it was only seconds 
i see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert of eternal fire hate ya deny yourself of a blessing 
meanwhile i'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce 
renewed vows with sinners homies enemies too 
gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke with a thousand troops crip and piru nigga woop woop 
love i depend on white dubs i depend on 
they flying through this end zone that meant on to vent on so listen homie 
you miss me with that bullshit i keep my distance homie 
i'm on a higher pulpit you cannot visit homie 
i mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit it's like an anti depressant you see the vision homie 
i mean this godly advice fucking right 
even if you pinch me twice yes i 
keep dreaming
