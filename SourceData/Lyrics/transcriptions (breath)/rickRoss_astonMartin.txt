When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall 
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call? 
My down bitch 
one that live by the code 
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road 
A lot of quiet time 
pink bottles of rose Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold 
Following fundamentals and following in the rental 
I love a nasty girl that swallows what's on the menu 
That money triple up when ya get it out of state 
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space 
Elroy Jetson I'm somewhere out in space 
In my two seater she's the one that I would take
