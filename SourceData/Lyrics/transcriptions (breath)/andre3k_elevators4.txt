Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way 
that I just came from 
some nigga was sayin somethin 
talkin bout 
Hey man you remember me from school 
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown facial expression lookin silly And he kept askin me 
what kind of car you drive 
I know you paid
I know y'all got buku of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made 
And I replied that I had been goin through the same thing that he had 
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me 
to the end of the week I live by the beat like you live check to check 
If you don't move yo foot then I don't eat so we like neck to neck 
Yes we done come a long way like them Slim ass cigarettes 
from virginia 
this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue
