If your woman steps out with another man 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And she runs off with him to Japan 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And the I R S says they want to chat 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
With eighteen phone calls to Brazil 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And you borrowed money from the mob 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks 
And yesterday you lost your job 
That's the breaks, that's the breaks
Well, these are the breaks 
Break it up, break it up, break it up
