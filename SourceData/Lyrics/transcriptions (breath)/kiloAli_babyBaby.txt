When I'm alone in my room I Sit and stare at the wall 
Brother can't find no love at all 
I'm gonna find you girl somewhere, somehow 
I need you right now 
Search the world, couldn't find that feelin
Cause your love is a one in a million Cause I like the way that you touch me 
And I like the way you love me 
And I'll really make it worth my while I said Woof Woof Woof Woof, doggy style 
Cause you're on my mind,
on my thoughts 
Let me see your body talk 
I'm makin love on a whole nother level 
Have you ever danced with the Devil 
When I'm around you I feel like this 
A kiss is just a kiss
