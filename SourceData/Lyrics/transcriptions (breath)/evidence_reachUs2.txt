You know these days ain't gettin any longer 
Now 
it's do or die Now or never time to hit the street 
We on the 
move 
Ride out 
with shit to prove 
Everywhere we go they like It's a green light for you 
Got lyrics about pleasure 
some about pain 
From Southern Cali where they say it never rains 
It's different things
that make me count blessings As we burn for our peeps that ain't here as we sing 
In God we trust no doubt 
that's a must
A hundred times see us bust still catch the rush
And when we fly 
bless the sky 
Let your mission unfold 
You in the car we in the bus bless the road 
How could I reach you if I wasn't real
Might have to go before you really studied the flow And understand the deal 
This year 
fuck before mad loud and clear 
You know that's the truth they can't
