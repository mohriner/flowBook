yo 
fly in it 
blue skies the limit the skies infinite 
it reflect in the eyes of those who try to send spies in it 
capture the sun if they could but they go blind by it 
look in the sky and i see africas eyes in it 
the land is dry like the cry infinite 
the tear we shed grow to fruit til the eye replenish
the industry wanna try to give my rhyme a sentence behind bars with my rhymes diminished they tryna end us but
all them clowns do is give my mind a senate to 
watch my peoples enemy die in my presence 
fly away on the highest adventure out on the line and enter the gate of zion need to decide who sent em i went through the jungle yeah 
stalking like a black panther 
raps answer to that cancer choking the life out the hood they wont let a man emancipate his people this refreshing like the spray of the bay in puerto rico
