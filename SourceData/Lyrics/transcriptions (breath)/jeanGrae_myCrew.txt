My family dream with me Under city lights Pump the light The screamers rights Just work it out but ya'll ain't hearing it
Words Travel deep in your spirit alone I cruise the block And use the box To serenade the moonlight with the speakers Niggaz lean back, 
deep in your seats and feel me 
Cliques and crews and hoods and gangs who love it I'm, loving you dearly 
Keep hustling Juggling Pressure, life, and success 
Those who made it Debate it Until another's death 
We buried ourselves under the jail Without shovels, and dirt under our nails 
Bubbles with crime and trouble tales And street violence turned extreme 
To ripping joints on stage To cutting fame time short To life supporting nothing But just realize what ya'll done 
We've given em reasons to scream on us And it's just begun 
What happened to us in the bigger picture 
Don't you understand when one of us falls Step and we're all fallin' with ya 
C'mon yeah
