i need you all to be clear on exactly what im sayin 
for your attention span i understand that i aint playin 
you mistaken if you somehow think its just me you facin 
starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent 
my heart is racin but i know just what i stand for we chasin death carelessly like jessica i care more who said 
just because no one can understand how you speak 
dont necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep 
in case you die in your sleep you ask the lord for a blessin sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin 
youll never know who the assassin is until its your time to go your life is flashin askin for forgiveness but you move too slow 
now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored 
you was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr 
life is hard death is harder 
you somebody baby father someones lover 
son of your mother somebody brother somebody nigga 
now your spirit in the air like a whisper 
hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor 
the days go by quicker and the nights dont seem to differ its gettin cold so i shivered and asked my soul to be delivered
