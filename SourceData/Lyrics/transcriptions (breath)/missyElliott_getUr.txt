Missy be puttin' it down, 
I'm the hottest round 
I told y'all motherfucker, 
y'all can't stop me now 
Listen to me now, 
I'm lastin twenty rounds 
And if you want me 
then come on get me now 
Is you with me now, 
then biggie biggie bounce 
I know you dig the way I sw sw switch my style 
Holla,
people sing around 
Now people gather round, 
now people jump around
