tell me who you loyal to 
is it money is it fame is it weed is it drink is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain 
big chillin' only for the power in your name 
tell me who you loyal to 
is it love for the streets when the lights get dark is it unconditional when the rari don't start 
tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
