Yeah where I'ma start it at 
look I'ma part of that 
Downtown Philly where it's realer than a heart attack 
It wasn't really that 
ill until the start of crack 
Now it's a body caught evry night on the Almanac 
Rock bottom where them cops gotta problem at 
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at 
I had nothin but I made somethin outta that 
Now I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack 
From two one five it's him 
the livest one 
And he's representin Philly to the fullest Blacks the realest 
You can't touch him
and not for nothin 
If you bout hip hop then you gots to love it If not then fuck it 
I'm still handlin 
Smokin more reefer than Redman and them 
damaging em sees And my name's 
Rick Gees you endangered species 
For what I do I'm about to up the fees I'm paper chase 
motivated I ain't 
the one to play with These cats
get set ablaze You can have it y'all way 
but I'd rather parlay
Just smoke 
oh gee and get 
cabbage all day The way 
thought play causes your main thing to say 
Your style so splendid 
you bout your business You arousing my intrests 
You sharper than a Shogun
You know the way it go huh 
game 
know what I'm talkin bout
