I used to ride the train the same two stops 
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops 
Like the same song playing on the jukebox 
Joint called Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox 
Regardless to what the cadence is 
It can't be forgotten like old acquaintances 
I reuhlize how depressing of a place it is 
And when I notice my reflection whose face it is
