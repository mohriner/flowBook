We got contra banded 
I recite poems about 
bein free
Only to a certain extent In a country run
by a president 
That doesn't know a single resident 
In my hood 
It is good Or that is fucked up I let 'em speak for me 
Break bread and peace treaty 
Across seas and these can't touch Till the feds get it And split it With other federals And fedarolos
agents and senators 
and representatives that live off us 
And feed off us 
For new ideas For years Niggaz been raped Let's escape This dope 
But how? 
When it's locked into our chemistry 
for Cuz nigga that's all we know 
That's how we grow
