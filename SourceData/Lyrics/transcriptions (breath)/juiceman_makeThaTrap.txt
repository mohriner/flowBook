I'm booming,
I'm bunking, 
I'm serving all the babies 
Rap game easy but the dope game gravy 
Young Juice man and my life is like the J Kid With stupid fruity crazy swag, 
jumping on your lady 
Banana donk Chevy interior like the Lakers 
LeBron James wrist when I'm fuckin' with the capers 
Hit the trap, stay down, watch the paper Wake up, 
booming out the house and J asking for a waiter 
Half a brick, whole brick, got me buying Jacobs 
Bourbon shoes, 
walking in the head of the gators
