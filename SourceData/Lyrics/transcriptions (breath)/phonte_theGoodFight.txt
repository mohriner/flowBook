Up early with the sun, and the stars, 
six A.M. ring the alarm 
Weather man say it's ninety today 
but it gon' feel like a hundred tomorrow So throw some fresh water under the arms 
Bullshit soon as I come in the job 
Boss hit me with the news like a box cutter under the jaw 
Said they just had a meeting and about three hundred 
Of y'all gettin fired cuz we been defunded 
Can't say I didn't even see it coming 
I always knew that one day, 
they'd find a way to throw me to the wolves And once they, 
came into my room on that Friday afternoon I was thinkin why you faggot ass niggas couldn't find me on Monday 
I know it's not sane, 
but yo I'm just sayin 
Everybody prays for the day they see the light But the light at the end of the tunnel is a train 
Five dollar gas, and poverty rates, 
are rising much higher than your hourly rates 
So if you thinkin bout quittin you should probably wait 
Cuz everybody gotta do a fuckin job that they hate 
Go and live out your dreams thats what they tellin 
Fam in my ear all day and they yellin 
Keep it real Te, and don't ever sellout 
But how the fuck you sell out when ain't nobody sellin?
