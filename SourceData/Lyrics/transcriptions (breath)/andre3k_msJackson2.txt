Ten times out of nine 
now if I'm lyin find 
the quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen then the puppy love thing together dream bout that crib with the goodyear swing
on the oak tree I hope we feel like this forever 
forever 
forever ever 
forever ever
forever never seems that long until you're grown 
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong 
Ms. jackson my intentions were good I wish I could 
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder 
thoughts of me 
thoughts of she 
thoughts of he a
skin what happened to the feelin that her and me 
Had
I pray so much about it need some knee 
pads 
It happened for a reason one can't be
mad 
So know this know that everything's cool 
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
