The Shakespeare of sixteens dipping my ink pen 
Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin 
Painting pictures of me but they never get my chin 
One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess
Evry time I indent 
you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent 
hanging on the evry sentence
Have no apprentice 
style uninherited 
Laughing at you peasants cause my penmanship is excellence Whenever in the presence 
eyes get wide 
I'm the town hero cause my words give them pride 
And what they feel inside 
I say the perfect words for em 
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for 
Leave them all astonished 
ride with the birds 
Make a grown man cry with shrimp on the words 
Tears to Mona Lisa 
Medusa to liquid 
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner wanna shoot shit Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked 
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deep throat til she hiccup
Had T D Jakes round this bitch doing stickups 
Rhymes so real thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs
