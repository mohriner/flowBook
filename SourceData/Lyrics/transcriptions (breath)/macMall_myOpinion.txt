My name is young Mac Mall man, and this is my opinion 
And since I got your attention there's some shit I'd like to mention 
Fuck them punk ass rollers 
them highway type of strollers 
Cause they be wanting to bust them big fat caps in ghetto souljas 
I guess they wanna fold us, 
but see we won't just have that 
Because I'm from the streets in ninety three and playas bust back 
I might just be a dead man 
Because I speak rebellion 
They ready did Malcolm X and Dr. King There ain't no tellin' 
The government they hatin me But still I pack three eighty 
Thats why I won't come back Uncle Sammy never paid me 
Still they try to fade me 
And today's the pay day 
I'm standing in the cuts fuckin it up 
with my A K 
forty seven ways them black brothas won't behave 
And since I'm stressed I'm on the quest to put them in their grave 
I'm trying to go to school but the system wasn't havin me 
Some say it's technicality 
but this is just reality 
In nineteen ninety two you know crazy I was feelin 
My name is young Mac Mall man, 
and this is my opinion
