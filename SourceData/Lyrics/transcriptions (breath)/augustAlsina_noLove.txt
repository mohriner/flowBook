Red light, 
you know I can't make this thing that official
Believe, we had a great night 
but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you 
shit
You don't like that, I make this easy, 
leaving 
After sexing on the floor
Baby I know you need me, 
like I need you
But I'm not the one you wanna love
So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You used to them 
but ain't no love in me
I hear what you was saying 
and girl it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane 
with a nigga like me
Let's just party til we can't, 
ain't no love in me
And I'm the one to blame, 
ain't no love in me 
so don't come looking for love
