Why is it you fail, to see a man
in the same hour,
that his kin come grinnin? 
In another code, fell asleep, party mode, tryin to come up 
from the ashes that defy your lift, listen up
Ladies seem sweet,
the ocean meets the mountain peaks Stone walker,
the side walker, watches loose lips, 
Wall Street 
Numbers set by stock movers, buy my tip so I can touch Not
for no print size, plate saint, white wasted H two Oh F
our coats will make it glaze Beams 
rooted like dogwood, between the Pine, wind Twenty four stores with malt for sale, still fetchin water out the well, help em size, find the grind, find the times where the times weighed as hard as you find me shoes, 
baby daddy 
Rico Daddy, he didn't break the TV 
So why should I weep, 
man gon' bye,
see you when my light blow 
Got more good than dirt to throw, and I won't pull between the halo, 
and a fork pitch 
Suffocated by my rhymes
