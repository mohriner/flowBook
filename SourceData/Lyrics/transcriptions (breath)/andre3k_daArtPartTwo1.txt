baby did you hear that yea baby I heard it too 
Look out the window golly the sky is electric blue 
mamma Earth is dyin and cryin because of you 
rainin cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate
to residue 
silly mortals haven't a clue
as to what the fuck is goin on I'm on the telephone dialin the dungeon 
This Dre 
bring the M P and the S P Meet me at the center of the earth and travel carefully 
baby grab the baby cause baby it ain't much time 
mamma Earth is tossin and turnin and that's our sign 
omega nigga I F owes are landin in decatur Hope I'm not over your head but if so you will catch on later Play the track

rapin her heavenly body like a hoe 
coochie so 
from niggaz constantly fuckin her never lovin her never showin appreciation bustin nuts in her face when they done
