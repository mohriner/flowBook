Lost generation, 
fast paced nation 
World population confront they frustration 
The principles of true hip hop have been forsaken It's all contractual and about money makin 
Pretend to be cats don't seem to know they limitation 
Exact replication and false representation 
You wanna be a man, then stand your own 
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown 
I let the frauds keep frontin 
And roam like a cellular phone far from home 
Givin crowds what they wantin 
Offical hip hop consumption, 
the fifth thumpin 
Keepin ya party jumpin with an original somethin 
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimensional No imagination, 
excuse for perpetration 
My man came over and said, Yo we thought we heard you 
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin ass crew but um
