low like sweet chariot 
what i say make my voice deep as barrys get 
carry it like a torch 
give birth to rhymes to meet beats then ill marry em off 
have a divorce if the track is wack please 
my rhymes a rolling stone 
home is where the high hatters at its on this song
maybe one day itll settle down 
it aint no good it all better now 
come on let it now
