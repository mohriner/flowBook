His palms are sweaty, 
knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, 
mom's spaghetti He's nervous,  
but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, The whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, 
everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, 
time's up, over, 
bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh 
there goes gravity Oh, 
there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't 
give up that Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows 
his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
