Call me the Juice and you know I'm a stunt 
Ridin in the car with some bump in the trunk 
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump 
Breakin down the good green, rollin the blunt 
Ghetto pimp tight girls say I'm the mayne 
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain 
Ridin through the hood, got me grippin the grain 
And I'm sippin the same, while I'm changin the lane 
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green 
Vision messed up cause I'm drinkin to lean 
Messin with a d Boy, ridin them big toys Make your man gal wanna get on my team 
She gotta give it up before she get in my car 
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star 
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog In the V I P part and be buyin the bar
