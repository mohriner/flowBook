IM THE ILLEST RAPPER TO HOLD THE CORDLESS 
PATROLLING CORNERS
LOOKING FOR HOOKERS TO PUNCH IN THE MOUTH 
WITH A ROLL OF QUARTERS
IM MEANER IN ACTION THAN ROSCOE BEATING JAMES TODD SENIOR ACROSS THE BACK WITH VACUUM CLEANER ATTACHMENTS
I GREW UP IN A WILD HOOD 
AS A HAZARDOUS YOUTH
WITH A FUCKED UP CHILDHOOD THAT I USED AS AN EXCUSE
AND AINT SHIT CHANGED I KEPT THE SAME MIND STATE SINCE THE THIRD TIME THAT I FAILED NINTH GRADE
YOU PROBABLY THINK THAT IM A NEGATIVE PERSON 
DONT BE SO SURE OF IT
I DONT PROMOTE VIOLENCE 
I JUST ENCOURAGE IT
I LAUGH AT THE SIGHT OF DEATH AS I FALL DOWN A CEMENT FLIGHT OF STEPS AND LAND INSIDE A BED OF SPIDER WEBS
SO THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND 
YOU AND A FRIEND CAN JUMP OFF OF A BRIDGE 
AND IF YOU LIVE DO IT AGAIN
SHIT WHY NOT 
BLOW YOUR BRAIN OUT 
IM BLOWIN MINE OUT
FUCK IT 
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE YOU MIGHT AS WELL DIE NOW
