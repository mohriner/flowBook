I drew a two of hearts from a deck of cards 
A stock trick from my empty repertoire 
Another hopeless story never read at all I'm better off looking for the end 
where the credits are 
It's pain living life against the grain 
I'm looking back and y'all look the same 
Troy Mark and little what's his name 
Memory is rerunning it all 
It's the flight of my fall 
and it's right on the wall
