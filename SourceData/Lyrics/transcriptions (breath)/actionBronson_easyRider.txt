Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat 
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel 
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul 
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol 
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival The best of all, 
had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call 
Best believe that there was neck involved 
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab 
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains 
Started running with the stallions 
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, 
did the tango with my kidneys Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need 
Rockin' very loose pants, 
yeah Rockin' very loose pants, 
yeah Bury a million in the sand, by the clock tower 
Before I die, take a hot shower
