Blue told me remind you niggas 
Fuck that shit y'all talking bout, 
I'm the nigga 
Caught up in all these lights and cameras 
But look what that shit did to Hammer 
God damn it it I like it 
Bright lights is enticing 
but look what it did to Tyson 
All that money in one night, 
thirty mill for one fight 
But soon as all the money blows, 
all the pigeons take flight 
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me, 
what I do, I took her back 
Fool me twice that's my bad, 
I can't even blame her for that 
Enough to make me wanna murder, 
momma please just get my bail 
I know nobody to blame, 
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself
