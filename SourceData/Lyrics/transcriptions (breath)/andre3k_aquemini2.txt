Twice upon a time there was a boy who died 
and lived happily ever 
after but that's another chapter live from 
home of the brave 
with dirty dollars 
beauty parlors 
baby bottles 
bowling ball impalas 
street scholars
majoring in culinary arts 
You know how to work bread cheese and dough 
from scratch 
but see the catch is you can get caught 
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk 
Let's walk 
to the bridge 
now meet me halfway 
now you may see some children dead off in the pathway 
it's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady 
It's lookin' bad need some hope like the words maybe 
if 
or probably 
more than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they don't fall 
I'm sorry y'all 
I often drift 
I'm talkin' gift so when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill 
of course you know I feel like the bearer 
of bad news 
Don't want to be it but it's needed 
so what have you 
Now question 
is every nigga with dreads for the cause 
Is every nigga with golds for the fall 
Naw 
So don't get caught in appearance 
it's outkast aquemini 
another Black experience
