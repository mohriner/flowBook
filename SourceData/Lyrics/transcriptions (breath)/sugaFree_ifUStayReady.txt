If I could get a dollar, for everytime you look at me sideways 
I'll pay the Westside on Friday's to build y'all playa haters y'all own highways 
Don't trip on me partner, 
no uh uh 
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary with AIDS tryin' to give me some nana 
You can't dictate mines, 
what I look like to you baby? 
Besides the feelin' is fine 
All natural like oat bran, engineered like no other 
Fly for life, still as a mannequin when it comes to my mother 
Capricorn baby and I'm stubborn just like you 
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool 
Don't get me twisted baby, 
I love you too 
But when that rent and that car note come what love gon' do? Baby, 
my money's on the clock, 
right around the block 
You see me stack big knot, 
my music's all I got So I'mma stay ready so I don't gotta get ready Cause I rose like King Tut and resurrect it like Amadeus
