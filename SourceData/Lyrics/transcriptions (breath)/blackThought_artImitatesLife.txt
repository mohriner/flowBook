Let's toast to paid mortgages, 
lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris's
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never ending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and spawn and his jay and tron
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October third niggas like me and Kwe
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate
