me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota 
a quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda 
janky stash box when the federales will roll up 
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor 
we on the mission for bad bitches and trouble i hope the universe love you today 
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate 
if its necessary 
bumpin jeezy first album lookin' distracted 
speaking language only we know you think it's an accent 
the windows rolled down all i see is a hand pass it 
hot boxing like george forman grilling the masses of the working world 
we pulled up on a bunch of working girls and asked em what they working with 
look at me 
i got the blunt in my mouth 
usually i'm drug free 
but shit i'm with the homies
