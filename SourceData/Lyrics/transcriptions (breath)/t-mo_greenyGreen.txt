Belligerent thoughts of militant ways 
Camouflaged in the brush, 
love or lust Which can we trust 
hidden in the cuts Terrible they bounce 'em every third month 
Yeah, after the big flood of truth, 
Caught in your own evidence Now you hesitant 
to believe me 
You back 
to hangin with Parks 
That's what you called her 
Now you run cause you know that's what you want 
If I felt like everything was good 
Maybe then I could knock on wood 
To protect the good
That surrounds my innermost thoughts 
Until my thoughts were caught 
unguarded
As hard as it is to be perfect I try 
And I still flaw 
listening to the next guy 
That knew more and saw it before I did
Came up big, to dig 
an early grave
Get locked up,
and turn a slave for the rhythm
We rap, 
still get slapped by the system
