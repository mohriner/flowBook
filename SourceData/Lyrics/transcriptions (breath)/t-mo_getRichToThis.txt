From the bottom to the top now it's hot; 
keepin it heated People about to see they chasin after cash in the ass 
Suckers crash on the blast from the past 
Goodie Mo.B. Backbone and OutKast, 
whatchu think this was, black? 
Take your sorry ass watch me blow, 
turnin my lyrics in the flow 
This is how it go,
and it go, 
perfect picture paintin Million dollar hold in the Cascade, in the shade 
Well I is gon' get paid to dis, 
and find a wife to dis 
I'm bout to cut, like a knife to dis 
and find dat, and find dat, top top, we get rich to dis, yeah!
