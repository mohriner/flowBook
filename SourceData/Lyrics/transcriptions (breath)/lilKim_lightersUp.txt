I come from Bed Sty 
Where niggas either do or they gon' die 
Gotta keep the ratchet close by 
Someone murdered 
Nobody seen, nobody heard it 
Just another funeral service 
Niggas will get at you 
Come through shinin', they yap you 
In broad daylight kidnap you 
Best get clap through 
Police stay on us like tattoos 
Niggas only grind cuz we have to 
MONEY IS POWER 
Sling crack, weed, and powder Fiends come through every hour Its all about that dollar 
And we no deal with cowards 
Weak lamb get devoured By the lion in the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble The weak fold and crumble It's the land of trouble 
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers 
BIG comes first then the queen comes after
