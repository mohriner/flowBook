hello lord it's me again 
I 
just wanna make love to the whole globe And all her girlfriends 
now don't that make ya mind move 
Like smoke patterns 
me on my way to saturn wit a bomb 
Numb be it view or saudi shawty 
I 
figure before the first gun blast they know who gone win 
Now won't that make us all fools 
Like class clowns 
praying private ryan comes round 
Sound 
travels at one thousand one thirty 
feet per second niggaz in the street they want it hurry 
When niggaz start biting that's when three thousand starts to worry 
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray murray answer quick do you know what desire is 
apparently not that's why you get what you got Now answer this do you know what fire is 
The body of hot 
the motivator of pots 
Snot spit shit are characteristics of release Ask your niece or nephew you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms Thank I'm finna vom 
Ya move like ya mean it she'll cum 
Prom night might excite a down right fight like White blood cell to the common cold rebel 
Night gets jealous of day 
play is no longer The feelin gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale
