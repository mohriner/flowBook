I write raps And when niggas bite, I clap 
Cos their shit sounds better now 
You done let me down 
Cause I thought you would be dope, but instead 
Your shit's dead; 
You gets fed To the alligators lurking in the moat 
Peep what I wrote 
You bit so hard, I though the shit was a quote. 
But still I'm taxing, axing 
the competition
And any wack men, I stomp and dis em 
Easily 
And you can feel the pressure, plus When I bust MCs'll be 
Trampling each other trying to exit 
When I flex it 
The way I wreck shit is not unexpected 
Niggas just lose when I choose The best crews of MCs And turn em into refugees 
I slaughter A lotta MCs with all the 
Styles I compiles 
and cut em off like valves 
Think to yourself I write the shit 
So you can bite the shit 
And I'll know, despite you get props 
Niggas get dropped
