Right now I'm smiling 
taking advantage of this moment Cause there might not be another soon 
holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars 
tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker But to you
I may appear to be your average joe But little do you know that even joe got problems that he gots to joust with 
floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel 
In this race oh you just can't quit 
Ain't that a bitch that being heat 
I'm on the beat 
like cops 
only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops 
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box 
Why 
Cause in a sense 
See we all be kind of fly Just can't be scared to spread your wings 
Head to better things 
maybe the mockingbird and nightengale they want to sing 
keeping this thing alive 
To the table's what we bring
We like hail storms and blizzards in the middle of the spring extraterrestrial
