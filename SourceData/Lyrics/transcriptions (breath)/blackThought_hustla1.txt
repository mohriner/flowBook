Let me tell you what priceless is 
some advice to give 
A sacrifice is what I made for the wife and kids 
They say life's a bitch but it's one life to live
I want my baby where that cake and the icing is 
Out of them crisis is 
off of them vices is 
They see what we do and grow up in all likenesses 
Really I don't wanna see em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz I'mma rewrite the script 
Daughter of a hip 
hopper hustla like her grand pappa 
Her destiny done been determined so you can't stop her 
From being independent earning paper and proper 
More like a lawyer or a doctor not a man watcher 
That's where your man got ya it's a big world out yeah 
I'm trying to make a black 
diamond or a pearl out yeah 
And hit the people to the way the world twirl out yeah
And when I thank heaven for my little girl
