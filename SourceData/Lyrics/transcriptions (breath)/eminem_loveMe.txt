THERE'S A CERTAIN MYSTIQUE WHEN I SPEAK 
THAT YOU NOTICE THAT IT'S SORTA UNIQUE
CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S ME 
MY POETRY'S DEEP AND I'M STILL MATIC THE WAY I FLOW TO THIS BEAT
YOU CAN'T SIT STILL 
IT'S LIKE TRYIN TO SMOKE CRACK AND GO TO SLEEP I'M STRAPPED
JUST KNOWING ANY MINUTE I COULD SNAP
I'M THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF BUSH RAPPED I BULLY THESE RAPPERS SO BAD LYRICALLY
IT AIN'T EVEN FUNNY I AIN'T EVEN HUNGRY IT AIN'T EVEN MONEY YOU CAN'T PAY ME ENOUGH FOR YOU TO PLAY ME IT'S COCKAMAMIE
YOU JUST AIN'T ZANY ENOUGH 
TO ROCK WITH SHADY MY NOODLE IS COCKADOODLE 
MY CLOCKS CUCKOO
I GOT SCREWS LOOSE 
YEAH THE WHOLE KITTENKABOODLE I'M JUST BRUTAL 
IT'S NO RUMOR I'M NUMERO UNO 
ASSUME IT
THERE'S NO HUMOR IN IT NO MORE YOU KNOW
I'M ROLLIN WITH A SWOLLEN BOWLING BALL IN MY BAG YOU NEED A FAG TO COME AND TEAR A NEW HOLE IN MY ASS
YOU BETTER LOVE ME BITCH
