Live life in legacy is my destiny nigga for sure
You know 
I'd rather take it slow though
Hopping out the four door 
Ride 
Dramatized off in this game but it ain't no disrespecting myself So it ain't no disrespecting my game Can you hear me man
Better watch where you walking if you talking that shit Especially if you counterfeit
Fuck around and get your wig split 
Tryna dig shit
But really I ain't no murderer 
But hear me when I say
Nigga I ain't never heard of ya 
Full of that weed
I get to belling on the block Doin bout four five
Takin nothing from none of ya'll So you know I ain't no jive
Nigga that's my mentality what
Don't catch no casualty
Nigga cause in reality what
It's bout a salary
Nigga I'm from a town called fresh Off your motherfucking ass
Steady mobbing to the gun blast 
Take a turn in my way
See me playin wit my A K 
And smoking on some hay on Valentine's Day
Nigga hah 
hear me say what
