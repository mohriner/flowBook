who is k dot 
a young nigga from compton on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot 
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell 
the fraudulent tender scars'll get unveiled 
everyone i knew was either crip or piru cousins in elementary relatives in high school 
with that being said each one of their rivals was aiming something at my head i needed survival 
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back and i don't even push a line i'm just tryna push these rhymes 
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete 
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep 
but what you can consider 
that if it goes down they'll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga 
so if you axe what i'm doing i'm tryna duck the influence 
of my city that's brewing 
real talk
