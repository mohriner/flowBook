It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it You playin' with fire, burning you slow, hold up 
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo 
I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo coo With a cal, aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down Came too far for my feet to fail me 
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up 
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday 
in every way I won't let up, 
I won't shut up 
You can't stop me, 
you won't knock me, ten four, now copy 
Live almighty, 
my declaration been written In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen
