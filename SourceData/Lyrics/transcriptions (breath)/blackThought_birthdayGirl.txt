Now, she told me cheddar cheese grits, two tomato fried fish
Cause she heard it's my dish, 
tryna be my sidekick
All the people all around thinking she was my chick
Sayin, "Damn, the girl thick, 
but she ain't no twenty-six"
Lookin at me like I'm up to something on the funny tip
Like I ever really been the one to try the honey drip
It's your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get
In fact, 
blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me
