i live this life at a pace that anyone can go 
know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that you'll die alone 
trace your steps when i do step in a fire of broken bones and i require my heart's desire and when i reap what i sew 
i bought my momma benz 
my boobie a jag 
a car for my dogs 
with a roof full of glass 
but still i be feeling like none of my light never casts 
out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast but fuck that 
i'm not worried 
even when it's scary 
skirt off makin' them hurt off should have hurt them in a hurry 
dirt off all of my fingers dirt on all of em gon is hurricane 
shirt off when procedure resuscitation came early i need you to keep quiet as a mouse 
which is ironic cause rats is what i'm talking about 
i'm hearin the sonics of gun fire the whispers the silent cries even though we know it's eye for an eye
