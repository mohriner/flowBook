I WENT IN HEADFIRST
NEVER THINKING ABOUT WHO WHAT I SAID HURT 
IN WHAT VERSE
MY MOM PROBABLY GOT IT THE WORST
THE BRUNT OF IT 
BUT AS STUBBORN AS WE ARE
DID I TAKE IT TOO FAR
CLEANING OUT MY CLOSET AND ALL THEM OTHER SONGS BUT REGARDLESS I DON'T HATE YOU CAUSE MA
YOU'RE STILL BEAUTIFUL TO ME 
CAUSE YOU'RE MY MOM
THOUGH FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO BE CALM OUR HOUSE WAS VIETNAM
DESERT STORM 
AND BOTH OF US PUT TOGETHER CAN FORM AN ATOMIC BOMB EQUIVALENT TO CHEMICAL WARFARE
AND FOREVER WE CAN DRAG THIS ON AND ON BUT 
AGREE TO DISAGREE
THAT GIFT FROM ME UP UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE DON'T MEAN SHIT TO ME
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT 
IT'S FIFTEEN DEGREES AND IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE 
LITTLE PRICK JUST LEAVE
MA LET ME GRAB MY FUCKING COAT 
ANYTHING TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S GOATS WHY WE ALWAYS AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS
ESPECIALLY WHEN DAD HE FUCKED US BOTH
WE'RE IN THE SAME FUCKING BOAT 
YOU'D THINK THAT IT'D MAKE US CLOSE NOPE
FURTHER AWAY IT DROVE US 
BUT TOGETHER HEADLIGHTS SHINE A CAR FULL OF BELONGINGS STILL GOT A WAYS TO GO 
BACK TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE IT'S STRAIGHT UP THE ROAD
AND I WAS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE THE OLDEST SO MY SHOULDERS CARRIED THE WEIGHT OF THE LOAD
THEN NATE GOT TAKEN AWAY BY THE STATE AT EIGHT YEARS OLD AND 
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED YOU WERE SICK AND IT WASN'T FIXABLE OR CHANGEABLE AND TO THIS DAY WE REMAINED ESTRANGED AND I HATE IT THOUGH BUT
