I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe 
Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A 
And I been witness to this history, 
ever since the tenth grade 
We went from rockin' braids to temp fades 
I twist my A hat to the side just for style 
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly 
Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down 
It ain't so country though nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle I'm Sergeant Slaughter, 
I keep my shit cooked to order in order To satisfy my people in Georgia and cross the water And 
across the border the essays are gettin' smarter They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchilladas 
If you follow, wink wink, no doubt, we don't speak In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink 
I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat 
It's that nigga the b i g
