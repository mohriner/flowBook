friends romans countrymen 
lend me ya ears stop repentin cause the ending is near but dont 
panic you cant function if you livin in fear 
pay attention you gotta listen to hear 
cmon 
who the fuck you think you talkin to 
put you on hold get a specialist to walk you through 
kweli 
the flow captain of fast and slow rappin im so crackin you aint heard ya shit appear like closed captions 
king of the bars and im goin hard pause 
all my confidence comes from knowin gods laws 
bangin on the system 
fightin my kinda war 
loud as a whisper 
quiet as a lions roar
