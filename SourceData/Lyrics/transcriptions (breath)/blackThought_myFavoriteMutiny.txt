Move, 
if you got the nerve
Lash out for your just deserts It's not just a word
Some of y'all heads up in the clouds
I'mma bring y'all back to earth 
It's Black back to burn
The Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout
Out ya mouth. I'm not concerned Cause y'all got to learn
It's y'all turn like Detroit Red
When his head had an ultra perm The long walk 
will burn your bare heels So throw on your boots
The game camouflaged like army suits
But I can see it more clear cause I came with the Coup in here
Ring the alarm and form the troops
Send em out into the world, go to war in a fluke
Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot
Now I'm comin' at ya neck, sick of hearing something wrong with me
Motherfucker something's wrong with you
With a Chief just way too smart to question
The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion
The governments of the world is shark infested
They heavy on weaponry like Charlton Heston
