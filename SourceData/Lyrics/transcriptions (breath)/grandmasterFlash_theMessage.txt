Broken glass everywhere People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care 
I can't take the smell, 
can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice 
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back 
Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat 
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
