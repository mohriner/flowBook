I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said baby boy you only funky as your last cut 
You focus on the past your ass'll be a has what 
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure andre
got to her station here's my destination She got off the bus the conversation lingered in my head for hours Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin with it But I'm witcha you cause you probably goin through it anyway 
But
anyhow 
when in doubt 
went on out and bought it Cause I thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawsky 
wawsky 
awfully it's 
sad and it's costly 
but that's all she
wrote And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit creek it's weak is the last quote 
That I want to hear when I'm goin down when all's said and done And we got a new joe in town 
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down 
All ya'll can say is them niggas earned that crown but until then
