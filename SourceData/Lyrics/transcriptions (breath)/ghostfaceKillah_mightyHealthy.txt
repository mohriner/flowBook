Both hands clusty, 
chilling with my man Rusty Low down, 
blew off the burner kinda dusty 
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co host 
Monty Hall expo, 
intellect, you read pro 
Son trifling fuck, 
wildflower on the cycle and 
Picked up the broom thought I was Michaelin' 
West Brighton Pool, 
now 
I'm into Iron Duels 
Turn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, 
she at Allah school 
Inhale break beats of hell A Alikes propel parallel 
Duracell knot, you flash a burnt cell S
nap out of Candy Land kids, the old rumor is 
Blacks become immune and shit, 
we never did Like 
eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy 
over herbs Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar 
Scissor hand 
wig vanished in the winter, living off land You god damn right 
I fuck fans, king me 
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder 
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now
