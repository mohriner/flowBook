Niggas claim that they're after me, but 
this ain't what they want 
Cause I hopped into this industry, 
this ain't what they want 
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, 
this ain't what they want 
I got the police all into me, 
this ain't what they want 
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me 
Fuck T M Z, 
fuck Breaking News and A B C 
I can't do no shows 
cause I terrify my city, 
they say I terrify my city 
Niggas get slumped,
you're the first to get blamed 
A nigga try us, 
he the first one to get changed 
They say He snitch, 
tryna put dirt on my name 
They ride on me 
ask is Lil Durk my name
