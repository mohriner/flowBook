Tryna control the fits of panic 
Unwritten and unraveled it's the dead man's pedantic Whatever 
see it's really just a matter of semantics
When evrybody's fresh out of collateral to damage and 
my splaying got me praying like a mantis I begin to vanish 
Feel the pull of the blank canvas 
I'm contemplating 
that special dedication To whoever it concern 
my letter of resignation Fading 
back to black 
my dark coronation 
The heat of the day 
the long robe of muerte 
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay 
If there's a heaven I can't find a stairway
