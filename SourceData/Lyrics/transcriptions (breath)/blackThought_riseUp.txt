When I rise up 
I bruise, never broken
I move with a short fuse, my wounds never open
I swung and I caught dudes, my tools left them soaking in blood
For my determination is just but a token
My garland is bare knuckle brawling, ain't never falling My sword in the air's more than the warning of global warming When I'm strong-arming 
the brawn of a longshoreman it's a storm forming
I hit as hard as George Foreman in a square circle
When my intention is to hurt you I'mma better alert you
That's where prevention is a virtue Be a body without a tomb, 
you're running out of fuel I'mma throw you a sonic boom, 
show you how to duel Bring you into the house of pain, 
putting out your flame When I finish you like a game 
your crew will get the same
You tryna throw 
shame in my plans to make a name
I'mma put it on a weapon 
and put it in your brain I'm a street fighter
