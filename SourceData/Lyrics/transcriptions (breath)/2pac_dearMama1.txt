When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; 
and scared to go home, I was a fool with the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, 
the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, 
it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy 
tryna raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, 
tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
