Before I rise and shine like a neon sign 
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein 
And burn the marijuan like 
Buju Banton is my only bonafide break from these confines 
I need a change of scenery like a mind tide
These kids bringing me the noise like the bomb squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside I'm tired, 
it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod 
and walk around the crib doing little odd jobs 
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game 
from the sideline
I got to try diffrent things in these trying times 
Twenty ten is diffrent than it was in nine five 
It's come alive time,
I picked a fine time 
for getting open off life like a fine wine
