I'm sick 
sick of waiting in vain tired of playing the game Thinking of making a change 
finally breaking the chains 
Every phase every happening craze When it's said and done 
my head is right back in a haze I'm ready for the next 
chapter and page to start
acting my age And part 
ways with Black Thought 
from back in the days I'm star gazing from the back of the stage 
wondering if who y'all praise is worthy of praise 
What's the phrase bygones is bygones
Niggas who used to be the underdogs 
is icons 
People say the light shines once in a lifetime 
Is this mid life kind 
of crisis a little bit like mine 
I'm thinking not now but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around do the right thing like Spike now 
The quick and the dead 
which one is my look alike now
I'm moving ahead
