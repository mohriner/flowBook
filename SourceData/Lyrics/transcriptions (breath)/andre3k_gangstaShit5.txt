outkast wit a K yeah them niggaz are hard
harder than a nigga trying to impress God 
We'll pull your whole deck fuck pulling your card And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
and play the sweetest melody the street ever heard Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs Get full 
and niggaz niggaz pop pop lock lock to the to the beat beat As
if the pitbulls
went out of style made a vow to myself If it's for the wealth i'll stop 
well put i like this It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop 
Wrong reason 
whatever the season 
hey winter spring summer or fall I don't stall slow drag wit your brain against the wall
Yeah nigga naw we learn to the side don't fall
All y'all 
fuck boys 
tuck toys inside your pants 
Just to pull it out point it at the ground and 
make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for
you're on that reefer
and on that tupac In front of them oooh wops
trying to show out
that's the hoe route 
talking loud 
talking bout that's gangsta shit
