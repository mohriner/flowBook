i walked in and they stared see how they screwin me break you down til you aint the man you used to be 
domination of my jurisdiction 
peoples addiction to lies it blurs the lines between the fact and fiction 
now we back omission 
i fix your face for you keep yappin
you start to hate the man in the mirror like michael jackson
