Uh puttin forth the effort to make a change
Not doin a lot of talkin bout it
what's yo game? 
You slippin 
you can't never do that 
That's when you get jacked 
For yo life over emotions runnin wild Like salamanders 
swimmin in southwest creeks 
Feelin incomplete 
Another story 
Livin in glory back to your has you had it
now you lost it 
was it worth it 
look what it costed 
Yo life 
young nigga
Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger 
Better think fast or get 
swept off yo feet 
Nigga it hurts to see 
these drugs deteriorate The minds of 
knuckle heads that want
to be 
base heads
Don't say 
I didn't tell you 
cuz you gon see
in the future 
I hope I don't have to shoot you 
If you switch
Went from hardcore to beggin like a bitch
Revolutions good to bad Hoods to rags 
real niggas to fags 
What's the news? 
But I refuse to lose
