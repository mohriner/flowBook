softly as if I played piano in the dark 
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark 
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part 
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts the job of speakin through us we be so sincere with this here 
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day 
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon that never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay
