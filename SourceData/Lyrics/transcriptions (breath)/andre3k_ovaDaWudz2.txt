everybody wanna get signed but 
record companies act like pimps gettin paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps but ain't no goodyear
I tell it like it is so I'm like look here 
Just willin to get what I deserve my kids to have a mother and a little house 
with a dog in the backyard goin woof woof 
Who knows what i'ma say soon's I leave this recording booth 
Poof 
back in the real world where birds fly 
From miami by way of cuba to whoever wants to get that high 
There's clouds of clowns 
seas of G's 
projects 
packed with playas meditating on their knees Just to make them ends meet
like ground beef you won't believe 
The shit that niggaz attempt cause they got other mouths to feed besides they own
