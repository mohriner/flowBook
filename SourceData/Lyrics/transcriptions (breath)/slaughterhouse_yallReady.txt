lord niggas get your weight up 
fuck y'all, pay up 
My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up 
Nicer than me, say what? 
Wait up, 
straight up 
I finish niggas right off the bat 
like a lay up 
I seen a lot of come, 
I seen a lot of go 
But y'all know where I'm from, 
B R double O 
You know the rest pimpin', 
yeah, I was bred different 
Here come pops with the N Y bop, 
you know, the leg limpin' 
My ice mug frozen till it's stiff 
Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women 
Let em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in em 
I might just throw em a gold fronts 
Pour up a cup of E and J and light up a dro blunt 
I was never soft, 
never saw me flinchin' when they letting off 
Never had to retaliate cause I set it off
